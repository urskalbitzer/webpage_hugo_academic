	abstract = {Social network analysis is quickly becoming an established framework to study the structure of animal social systems. To explore the social network of a population, observers must capture data on the interactions or associations between individuals. Sampling decisions significantly impact the outcome of data collection, notably the amount of data available from which to construct social networks. However, little is known about how different sampling methods, and more generally the extent of sampling effort, impact the robustness of social network analyses. Here, we generate proximity networks from data obtained via nearly continuous GPS tracking of members of a wild baboon troop (Papio anubis). These data allow us to produce networks based on complete observations of interindividual distances between group members. We then mimic several widely used focal animal sampling and group scanning methods by subsampling the complete data set to simulate observational data comparable to that produced by human observers. We explore how sampling effort, sampling methods, network definitions and levels and types of sampling error affect the correlation between the estimated and complete networks. Our results suggest that for some scenarios, even low levels of sampling effort (5–10 samples/individual) can provide the same information as high sampling effort ({\textgreater}64 samples/individual). However, we find that insufficient data collected across all potentially interacting individuals, certain network definitions (how edge weights and distance thresholds are calculated) and misidentifications of individuals in the network can generate spurious network structure with little or no correlation to the underlying or ‘real’ social structure. Our results suggest that data collection methods should be designed to maximize the number of potential interactions (edges) recorded for each observation. We discuss the relative trade-offs between maximizing the amount of data collected across as many individuals as possible and the potential for erroneous observations.},

	abstract = {Simulating South American biodiversity
The emergence, distribution, and extinction of species are driven by interacting factors—spatial, temporal, physical, and biotic. Rangel et al. simulated the past 800,000 years of evolution in South America, incorporating these factors into a spatially explicit dynamic model to explore the geographical generation of diversity. Their simulations, based on a paleoclimate model on a 5° latitude-longitude scale, result in shifting maps of speciation, persistence, and extinction (or cradles, museums, and graves). The simulations culminate in a striking resemblance to contemporary distribution patterns across the continent for birds, mammals, and plants—despite having no target patterns and no empirical data parameterizing them.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONIndividual processes that shape geographical patterns of biodiversity are increasingly understood, but their complex interactions on broad spatial and temporal scales remain beyond the reach of analytical models and traditional experiments. To meet this challenge, we built a spatially explicit, mechanistic model that simulates the history of life on the South American continent, driven by modeled climates of the past 800,000 years. Operating at the level of geographical ranges of populations, our simulations implemented adaptation, geographical range shifts, range fragmentation, speciation, long-distance dispersal, competition between species, and extinction. Only four parameters were required to control these processes (dispersal distance, evolutionary rate, time for speciation, and intensity of competition). To assess the effects of topographic heterogeneity, we experimentally smoothed the climate maps in some treatments.
RATIONALEThe simulations had no target patterns. Instead, the study took a fundamental approach, relying on the realism of the modeled ecological and evolutionary processes, theoretical derivations of parameter values, and the climatic and topographic drivers to produce meaningful biogeographical patterns. The model encompassed only the Late Quaternary (last 800,000 years), with its repeated glacial-interglacial cycles, beginning at a time when South America was already populated with a rich biota, comprising many distinct lineages. Nonetheless, current consensus holds that the contemporary flora and vertebrate fauna of South America include numerous lineages that have undergone rapid diversification during the Quaternary, particularly in the Andes. In our model, over the course of each simulation, a complete phylogeny emerged from a single founding species. On the basis of the full historical records for each species range, at each 500-year interval, we recorded spatial and temporal patterns of speciation (“cradles”), persistence (“museums”), extinction (“graves”), and species richness.
RESULTSSimulated historical patterns of species richness, as recorded by maps of the richness of persistent (museum) species, proved quite successful in capturing the broad features of maps of contemporary species richness for birds, mammals, and plants. Factorial experiments varying parameter settings and initial conditions revealed the relative impact of the evolutionary and ecological processes that we modeled, as expressed in spatial and temporal patterns of cradles, museums, graves, and species richness. These patterns were most sensitive to the geographical location of the founding species and to the rate of evolutionary adaptation. Experimental topographic smoothing confirmed a crucial role for climate heterogeneity in the diversification of clades, especially in the Andes. Analyses of temporal patterns of speciation (cradles) and extinction (graves) emerging from the simulations implicated Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles as drivers of both diversification and extinction on a continental scale.
CONCLUSIONOur biogeographical simulations were constructed from the bottom up, integrating mechanistic models of key ecological and evolutionary processes, following well-supported, widely accepted explanations for how these processes work in nature. Despite being entirely undirected by any target pattern of real-world species richness and covering only a tiny slice of the past, surprisingly realistic continental and regional patterns of species richness emerged from the model. Our simulations confirm a powerful role for adaptive niche evolution, in the context of diversification and extinction driven by topography and climate. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/361/6399/eaar5452/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Observed species richness versus modeled (simulated) richness.Upper map: Contemporary South American bird richness (2967 species).

Individual processes shaping geographical patterns of biodiversity are increasingly understood, but their complex interactions on broad spatial and temporal scales remain beyond the reach of analytical models and traditional experiments.

Experimental topographic smoothing confirmed the impact of climate heterogeneity on diversification. The simulations identified regions and episodes of speciation (cradles), persistence (museums), and extinction (graves). Although the simulations had no target pattern and were not parameterized with empirical data, emerging richness maps closely resembled contemporary maps for major taxa, confirming powerful roles for evolution and diversification driven by topography and climate.
Mechanistic simulations of climate dynamics, speciation, and adaptive evolution yield realistic geographical patterns of biodiversity.

	abstract = {In many mammalian species, philopatric females reside with female kin with whom they form long-lasting cooperative bonds, whereas dispersing males rarely form strong bonds with other males. However, males may have the opportunity to disperse and form long-lasting bonds with paternal male kin in species with high male reproductive skew and parallel male dispersal. We used 54 group-years with demographic and genetic data to investigate how male dispersal and reproductive patterns affected the distribution of male kin in the Santa Rosa white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus imitator). During 41 of 54 group-years, there was a high degree of reproductive monopolization by either the alpha or a subordinate male. Natal males often co-resided with paternal brothers of similar age. The likelihood of parallel dispersal from the natal group increased with age similarity and paternal sibship. Some males may possibly gain inclusive fitness benefits by engaging in parallel dispersal and forming long-term cooperative bonds with other males. However, only one of three groups displayed a positive association between male-­ male relatedness and time spent co-resident in the breeding group. Inbreeding avoidance between alpha males and their daughters also gives subordinate males an opportunity to gain direct fitness benefits and may provide a strong incentive for cooperation among males that are not close kin. These findings suggest that cooperation between related and unrelated males likely evolved due to different reasons.},

	abstract = {Many primate species exhibit high levels of behavioural variation that correlate with demographic variance across populations and within populations over time. Analyses of these relationships have typically treated behavioural variance as the product of individual responses to local ecological and demographic conditions and therefore indicative of behavioural flexibility. However, in contrast to the extrinsic nature of the variance in ecological conditions such as climate, food availability, or predation pressure, demographic variance can reflect both extrinsic processes and intrinsic properties of individual life histories, such as the timing and rate of fertility and dispersal decisions. If we follow the rationale for interpreting behavioural flexibility, then demographic flexibility would correspondingly reflect the responses of components of individual life histories that are free to vary to external stimuli. The dynamics between behavioural and demographic flexibility can shift over the course of individual lifespans and are expected to affect the size and composition of groups and populations and therefore levels of intrasexual competition and many other features of sociality. These dynamics also affect group and population growth rates, with implications for the recovery and management of small populations and the resilience of large populations subject to rapidly or unpredictably changing conditions. Longitudinal and cross-sectional data from the critically endangered northern muriqui (Brachyteles hypoxanthus) and other primate species provide comparative insights into patterns of behavioural and demographic flexibility that can advance our understanding of primate adaptive potentials and constraints over ecological and evolutionary time.},

This study examines the distribution of infant mortality in relation to seasonality for the endangered Sanje mangabey, Cercocebus sanjei, endemic to the Udzungwa Mountains, Tanzania. Data were collected over 40 continuous months (August 2008 to November 2011). Censuses conducted during monthly group follows recorded 35 live births, plus 6 births just prior to the start of the study data (23 females, 16 males and 2 of undetermined sex). The survival probability for these infants combined was 60.2\% (27 survived and 14 died before 1 year of age). Mean annual infant mortality (39.8 ± 4.1\%) was at the higher end of results reported for other wild cercopithecines. All infant deaths occurred within the dry season (June to October), although most (64\%, 9 of 14) were highly clustered within the early dry season (June to August), a period coinciding with an initial drop in fruit production and a peak in tick infestation among adult females. Six of the 14 infants that died were conceived in the previous dry season and born in the wet season; our previous work has demonstrated that this is considered ‘out-of-phase’ with optimal conceptive timing for the species. Previous studies in this species have demonstrated that timing conception with peak food abundance can influence infant survival. We also suggest that tick-borne disease, prevalent in the region, should be further studied as it could be a factor impacting infant mortality and may be interacting with decreasing nutritional intake during the early dry season.},

Owing to these characteristics, capuchins may be considered highly adaptable generalists, capable of occupying a wide range of habitats. The Panamanian white-­ throated capuchin (Cebus (capucinus) imitator) coexists with several other primate genera in Mesoamerica. Some taxa, such as the mantled howler monkey (Alouatta palliata) and Geoffroy’s spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), have broader geographic ranges than C. imitator. This may be due to historical biogeography (e.g. earlier colonization of the region by Ateles and Alouatta) or, alternatively, because some habitats may be less suitable for capuchins. We investigated the latter hypothesis using ecological niche models (ENMs) to predict range extent based on climate and elevation, as well as niche breadth. Our results suggest a narrow climate niche relative to the more wide-ranging Ateles geoffroyi, as well as Alouatta spp. Precipitation in the coldest quarter and temperature seasonality were the two most important climate variables for determining C. imitator habitat suitability. These findings may have implications for capuchins’ ability to persist through environmental changes (climate change and forest degradation, and loss) and warrant consideration in assessing their extinction risk.},

However, there are many ways to be ‘well-connected’ and it is unclear which aspects of sociality drive fitness benefits. Being well-connected can be conceptualized in four main ways: individuals can be socially integrated by engaging in a high rate of social behaviour or having many partners; they can have strong and stable connections to favoured partners; they can indirectly connect to the broader group structure; or directly engage in a high rate of beneficial behaviours, such as grooming. In this study, we use survival models and long-term data in adult female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) to compare the fitness outcomes of multiple measures of social connectedness. Females that maintained strong connections to favoured partners had the highest relative survival probability, as did females well-integrated owing to forming many weak connections. We found no survival benefits to being structurally well-connected or engaging in high rates of grooming. Being well-connected to favoured partners could provide fitness benefits by, for example, increasing the efficacy of coordinated or mutualistic behaviours.},

We aimed to investigate how ecological factors, social factors, and reproductive state are associated with energetic condition in a wild neotropical primate using non-invasive measures. We first assessed and compared urinary C-peptide levels (uCP), the presence of urinary ketones (uKet), and behaviorally assessed energy balance (bEB) in female white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus imitator) living in Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. Then, we assessed how these measures were associated with feeding competition, dominance rank, and reproductive state. As predicted, uCP and bEB were positively associated with each other, and bEB was negatively associated with uKet. However, we did not find a relationship between uCP and uKet. Females showed lower uCP and bEB values during periods of intense feeding competition, but this relationship was not dependent on dominance rank. Furthermore, rank was not directly associated with uCP and bEB. Urinary ketones, on the other hand, were only produced in the most adverse conditions: by low-ranking, lactating females during periods of intense feeding competition. Behavioral strategies are assumed to maximize reproductive success and not energetic condition per se, which might explain why rank was not generally associated with energetic condition in our study population. This highlights the importance of considering potential differences between reproductive success and proxies of reproductive success, such as energetic condition or food intake, when investigating predictions of socioecological models.},

	abstract = {While long‐term rainfall trends and related atmospheric dynamics have been researched over the past several decades across equatorial Africa, little is known about rainfall in western Uganda, a transition zone in the middle of the continent. Using satellite‐derived rainfall and reanalysis data from 1983 to 2017, this study examines atmospheric characteristics of seasons and multidecadal trends in rainfall. Most of the region has a biannual rainfall regime (i.e., the ﬁrst rains within March–May and the second rains during August–November). Ascending (descending) air and increased (decreased) speciﬁc humidity are observed over western Uganda during the rainy (dry) seasons. Southeasterly air‐parcel back trajectories are common throughout western Uganda at all times except for the ﬁrst dry season (i.e., December–February). For all seasons, wet days in western Uganda are characterized by increases in ascending air and speciﬁc humidity in addition to westerly ﬂow anomalies. Wet days in most seasons also have a disproportionately high frequency of westerly back trajectories extending over the Congo Basin. These Congo westerlies are associated with more vertical ascent and a more humid middle troposphere compared to the other trajectories. Rainy seasons, especially the ﬁrst rains, have gotten longer and wetter throughout western Uganda. The duration of the ﬁrst rains increased by about 1 month over the 35 years; in turn, the rainfall total increased by approximately 70\%. Rainfall also has increased for climatological seasons, with the exception being December–February. Increases in middle‐troposphere speciﬁc humidity and vertical ascent over time provide support for the wetting trends derived from the satellite‐derived rainfall data.},

Although different potential functions for the praesaccus have been suggested, little evidence exists to support any of the proposed functions. To address the issue of the function of the praesaccus, we collated literature data on diet and compared tripartite and quadripartite species. Our results suggest that the praesaccus is an adaptation to a dietary niche with a particularly high reliance on leaves as fallback foods in colobine clades with quadripartite stomachs, and a higher reliance on fruits/seeds as foods at times of high fruit availability in clades with tripartite stomachs. This supports the notion that a large gut capacity is an important characteristic by which folivores survive on a high fiber diet, and that this large gut capacity may not be necessary for some species if there are seasonal peaks in fruit availability.},

	abstract = {Animals lead rich social lives. They care for one another, compete for resources, and mate. Within a society, social relationships may be simple or complex and usually vary considerably, both between different groups of individuals and over time. These social systems are fundamental to biological organization, and animal societies are central to studies of behavioral and evolutionary biology. But how do we study animal societies?  How do we take observations of animals fighting, grooming, or forming groups and produce a realistic description or model of their societies? Analyzing AnimalSocieties presents a conceptual framework for analyzing social behavior and demonstrates how to put this framework into practice by collecting suitable data on the interactions and associations of individuals so that relationships can be described, and, from these, models can be derived.  In addition to presenting the tools, Hal Whitehead illustrates their applicability using a wide range of real data on a variety of animal species—from bats and chimps to dolphins and birds. The techniques that Whitehead describes will be profitably adopted by scientists working with primates, cetaceans, birds, and ungulates, but the tools can be used to study societies of invertebrates, amphibians, and even humans. Analyzing AnimalSocieties will become a standard reference for those studying vertebrate social behavior and will give to these studies the kind of quality standard already in use in other areas of the life sciences.},

	abstract = {Globally urban areas are expanding rapidly and this usually has negative effects on biodiversity. Despite this, some species manage to persist in urban areas, as is the case with African Crowned Eagles Stephanoaetus coronatus in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. As relatively little is known about African Crowned Eagle nestling diet, especially about how it changes with nestling age, we investigated this with nest camera-traps. We analysed temporal changes in prey composition and biomass delivery during the nestling stage. We also recorded which adults provisioned and attended the nest. The main prey fed to nestlings were Rock Hyrax Procavia capensis and Hadeda Ibis Bostrychia hagedash. Adult males did most of the food provisioning, especially at the start of the nestling period. We found a decrease in total prey number and biomass with nestling age. This may be caused by changing requirements of nestlings. Furthermore, delivering fewer prey at later nestling stages may be a facilitating mechanism to enhance fledging of the nestling. Although the total number of prey brought to the nest decreased, we found an increase in numbers of Vervet Monkey Chlorocebus pygerythrus in the diet with nestling age. This indicated an increase in larger prey being delivered to the nests as the nestling aged. We suggest that this could be caused by increased participation in hunting by the larger female as her nest attendance time decreased as the nestling aged. We conclude with emphasising the importance of protecting the Durban Metropolitan Open Space System (D’MOSS) zones for the persistence of this Near Threatened raptor species, and populations of its prey in urban areas for its breeding success.},

They have also evolved visual and olfactory signals indicating their presence and ripeness. In some systems, fruit color serves as a reliable visual signal of nutrient content. Yet even though many volatile chemicals used as olfactory signals derive from nutrients animals seek, it is still unknown whether fruit scent encodes information regarding nutrient content in wild fruits. We examine the relationship between olfactory signals and nutrient rewards in 28 fruiting plant species in Madagascar. We measured the relative amounts of four chemical classes in fruit scent using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, as well as the relative amounts of sugar and protein in fruit pulp. We found that protein levels are not associated with elevated amounts of chemically related volatile compounds in fruit scent. In contrast, sugar content is strongly associated with the chemical composition of fruit scent. To our knowledge, this is the first research to explore the connection between fruit chemical signals and nutrient rewards. Our results imply that in the case of sugar, fruit scent is predictive of nutrient content and hence an honest signal.},

	abstract = {Primates have long been used as indicator species for assessing overall ecosystem health. However, area-wide census methods are time consuming, costly, and not always feasible under many field conditions. Therefore, it is important to establish whether monitoring a subset of a population accurately reflects demographic changes occurring in the population at large. Over the past 35 years, we have conducted 15 area-wide censuses in Sector Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. These efforts have revealed important trends in population growth patterns of capuchin monkeys following the protection and subsequent regeneration of native forests. During this same period, we have also intensively studied a subset of the capuchin groups. Comparing these two datasets, we investigate whether the population structures of the closely monitored groups are reliable indicators of area-wide demographic patterns. We compare the overall group size and the individual age/sex class compositions of study groups and nonstudy groups (i.e., those contacted during area-wide censuses only). Our study groups contained more individuals overall with a larger proportion of infants, and there were indications that the proportion of adult and subadult males was lower. These differences can be ascribed either to sampling errors or real differences attributable to human presence and/or better habitat quality for the study groups. No other sex/age classes differed, and major demographic changes were simultaneously evident in both study and nonstudy groups. This study suggests that the Santa Rosa capuchin population is similarly impacted by large-scale ecological patterns observable within our study groups.},

	abstract = {The use of social networks to describe animal social structure is increasing, yet our understanding of how social networks respond to changing ecological conditions remains limited. Animal behaviour is often constrained by temporal or spatial variation in ecological conditions; how do behaviour and social organization respond to changing ecological conditions? We used a social network approach to ask this question in the pair-living sleepy lizard, Tiliqua rugosa. We attached GPS data loggers to lizards to record their movement, activity and social interactions during their activity period (October–December) in 2008–2010. The years varied substantially in ecological conditions, from hot and dry in 2008 to cool and wet in 2010. Our aim was not to suggest how individual climatic or ecological factors influence social organization, but to explore the stability of social structure over varying conditions. Lizards spent less time active and overlapped in home range area more with conspecifics in the driest year of the study (2008) than in subsequent years. Despite this variation in behaviour, the number and strength of connections in the social network were stable across years. Intrasexual associations were similar across years, but there was a lower incidence of intersexual associations in 2008 than in the other 2 years. Among male–female dyads, pairing intensity was lower in 2008, while for males, extrapair strength was higher in 2008. These results suggest that although the overall social network is tolerant to changes in ecological conditions, the nature of contacts within the network shifts in response to ecological variation.},

	abstract = {Objectives Lactation is a costly reproductive state for females, as it may entail decreased body condition, increased morbidity, and increased mortality risk. To offset these costs, mothers should allocate investment in infant care as a function of their physical condition. Here, we assessed the relationship between maternal condition and maternal investment in wild mantled howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata) to determine: (1) whether maternal physical condition varied as a function of food availability, activity levels and feeding effort throughout lactation; (2) whether maternal investment was affected by maternal condition and offspring age. Materials and methods We studied six adult females while rearing their immature offspring. We determined weekly food availability, C-peptide levels (as a measure of energy balance) in urine samples (306 samples), mothers' time budgets, feeding rates, time spent vigilant, and time spent carrying their offspring (for two years; 600 observation hours). Results C-peptide levels were positively related to food availability. Maternal care in terms of vigilance and offspring carrying peaked at early lactation and decreased progressively with offspring age. Carrying was positively related to C-peptide levels and was also influenced by variation in maternal condition throughout lactation. Discussion These results converge with previous theoretical and empirical studies on this topic and contribute to the growing evidence that nonhuman primate mothers allocate maternal care based on their current condition to maximize lifetime reproductive success.},

	abstract = {Recent work indicates that social structure has extensive implications for patterns of sexual selection and sexual conflict. However, little is known about the individual variation in social behaviours linking social structure to sexual interactions. Here, we use network analysis of replicate polygynandrous groups of red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) to show that the association between social structure and sexual interactions is underpinned by differential female sociality. Sexual dynamics are largely explained by a core group of highly social, younger females, which are more fecund and more polyandrous, and thus associated with more intense postcopulatory competition for males. By contrast, less fecund females from older cohorts, which tend to be socially dominant, avoid male sexual attention by clustering together and perching on branches, and preferentially reproduce with dominant males by more exclusively associating and mating with them. Collectively, these results indicate that individual females occupy subtly different social niches and demonstrate that female sociality can be an important factor underpinning the landscape of intrasexual competition and the emergent structure of animal societies.},

	abstract = {Interfemale competition regimes in primate societies have been described as despotic or egalitarian based on female social behaviour. Hierarchies and nepotism are typical of despotic primates, where dominance rank and kinship are known to be strong drivers of who grooms whom and who fights with whom. However, a general theory for what structures female–female interactions in egalitarian societies remains underdeveloped. We present two nonmutually exclusive hypotheses that each propose a mechanism for levelling social advantages in a group by conferring social favour to all or most females over time: transitory states (age, residency status and reproductive state) bias social interactions and/or reciprocity governs social interactions. In this study, we (1) determined that a group of red colobus monkeys, Procolobus rufomitratus tephrosceles, in Kibale National Park, Uganda, are highly egalitarian; (2) tested our hypotheses for how egalitarianism may be maintained in this group; and (3) analysed findings across primate studies for support for either hypothesis. In red colobus, agonistic interactions were predicted by age – a transitory state – and transitory states and reciprocity predicted grooming interactions: avid groomers, older females and short-term resident females received more grooming. In addition, behavioural indicators of social status (aggression given and grooming received) were not associated with reproductive success in red colobus, as might be expected in an egalitarian group where variance in fitness should be low. Across primates, we found that transitory states commonly structure social interactions in egalitarian societies but not in despotic societies and that reciprocity is highly variable, especially among egalitarian societies. Rotating social advantage as females shift among transitory states and/or reciprocate grooming may lower interfemale skew in social benefits and potentially in lifetime reproductive success in egalitarian groups, setting them apart from despotic societies where dominance hierarchies and kinship maintain a more static and unequal distribution of social advantage.},

	abstract = {Social structure is a fundamental component of a population that drives ecological and evolutionary processes ranging from parasite transmission to sexual selection. Nevertheless, we have much to learn about factors that explain variation in social structure. We used advances in biologging and social network analysis to experimentally test how the local habitat, and specifically habitat complexity, modulates social structure at different levels in wild populations. Sleepy lizards, Tiliqua rugosa, establish nonrandom social networks that are characterized by avoidance of some neighbours and frequent interactions with one opposite-sex individual. Using synchronous GPS locations of all adult lizards, we constructed social networks based on spatial proximity of individuals. We increased habitat structural complexity in two study populations by adding 100 short fences across the landscape. We then compared the resulting movement behaviour and social structure between these populations and two unmanipulated populations. Social connectivity (network density) and social stability, measured at weekly intervals, were greater in populations with increased habitat structural complexity. The level of agonistic interaction (quantified as scale damage) was also higher, indicating a fitness cost of greater social connectivity. However, some network parameters were unaffected by increased complexity, including disassortative mixing by sex, and at the individual level, social differentiation among associates (coefficient of variation of edge weights) and maximal interaction frequencies (maximal edge weight). This suggests divergent effects of changed ecological conditions on individual association behaviour compared to the resulting social structure of the population. Our results contrast with those from studies of more gregarious species, in which higher structural complexity in the environment relaxed the social connectivity. This shows that the response to altered ecological conditions can differ fundamentally between species or between populations, and we suggest that it depends on their tendency for gregarious behaviour.},

	abstract = {Many animals live and breed in colonies, and yet, with just a few exceptions, the value of the social bonds between colony members has rarely been examined. Social ties are important for group coordination at collective tasks, and social coordination can facilitate synchronized reproduction among colony members. Synchronized reproduction in turn can amplify the benefits of coloniality, such as social foraging and predator avoidance. We conducted a field study to investigate whether synchronized reproduction among individuals in replicated colonies is linked to the strength of their social bond, and whether these strong bonds are maintained beyond the reproductive period. We PIT-tagged wild zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), monitoring their reproduction and social foraging over two consecutive years. We then used social network analysis to characterize the strength of social bonds among birds in the population. We show that birds that are more synchronized in their reproductive timing (and breed in the same colony) had significantly stronger social ties both during and after reproduction than expected by chance. Our long-term sampling also revealed that the strong social ties between synchronized breeders were carried over across years. Our study reveals a strong correspondence between synchronized breeding and the social structure of the breeding colony. This suggests that the synchrony between pairs is not a simple process based on opportunity, but a mechanism underpinned by more complex sociality, which could be carried over to other behavioural contexts. The maintenance of cross-contextual social ties across years suggests that social structure could have extensive consequences on the overall life history of individuals in addition to playing a key role for the reproductive dynamics of colonial breeders.},

These models have rarely been investigated in species with exceptionally long male tenures, such as white-faced capuchins, where female mate choice for novel unrelated males may be important in shaping reproductive skew. We investigated reproductive skew in white-faced capuchins at Sector Santa Rosa, Costa Rica, using 20 years of demographic, behavioural and genetic data. Infant survival and alpha male reproductive success were highest in small multimale groups, which suggests that the presence of subordinate males can be beneficial to the alpha male, in line with the concession model's assumptions. None of the skew models predicted the observed degree of reproductive sharing, and the probability of an alpha male producing offspring was not affected by his relatedness to subordinate males, whether he resided with older subordinate males, whether he was prime aged, the number of males or females in the group or the number of infants conceived within the same month. Instead, the alpha male's probability of producing offspring decreased when he was the sire of the mother, was weak and lacked a well-established position and had a longer tenure. Because our data best supported the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis and female choice for strong novel mates, these hypotheses should be taken into account in future skew models.},

Oxford: Blackwell. p 195–218, 1989]. This theory predicts that agonistic (“contest”) competition should occur when food is distributed in discrete, defensible patches; in contrast, when food sources are distributed uniformly or randomly, non-agonistic (“scramble”) competition is expected. Primatologists usually measure resource density and patchiness from a botanical perspective, ignoring the biology of the animal being studied. Such an approach may be irrelevant in terms of how animals view the dispersion of resources. Using a novel focal-tree method that measures resource availability on a scale that is both spatially and temporally relevant to the animal under investigation, we take a cost-benefit approach to predict the frequency of food-related agonism in white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus) from 11 ecological and social variables. We retained four variables in the regression model: two representing the opportunity for aggression (i.e., feeding bout length and the number of feeding adult females), and two representing opportunity costs (i.e., fruit abundance and the number of potential feeding sites in the focal tree). The results of this study indicate that the amount of food-related aggression in white-faced capuchins can be predicted by variables representing the costs and benefits of contesting a food resource.

First, to what extent is female dominance status dependent on coalitional support? Second, how stable are female dominance hierarchies over multiyear periods? Third, what is the role of allogrooming in servicing long-term social relationships? We addressed these questions using data collected on Cebus capucinus at Lomas Barbudal and Santa Rosa, over a six-year period. Most female-female coalitions against females reinforced the existing dominance hierarchy, but such coalitions were 3–7 times more frequent at Lomas Barbudal than at Santa Rosa. The Lomas Barbudal group's female hierarchy was highly stable throughout the six years of observation, whereas all three of the intensively observed Santa Rosa groups experienced frequent dominance reversals accompanied by physical aggression. In the Lomas Barbudal group, grooming tended to be directed up the hierarchy, and more closely-ranked females groomed at higher rates than distantly-ranked females, whereas these patterns were not consistently found at Santa Rosa. At both sites, grooming was evenly balanced within 67\% of female-female dyads, and mothers of young infants received more grooming than other females did. Females did not spend more of their time grooming each other in groups containing more females than in groups containing fewer females, but they distributed their grooming less evenly among their female groupmates in the largest observed group of females. Some of the intersite differences may be attributable to differences in the rate of female mortality or transfer or both.},

How individuals are positioned within the wider social network (i.e. their indirect social connections) has been shown to be repeatable, heritable and related to key life-history variables. Yet, there remains a general lack of understanding surrounding how complex network positions arise, whether they indicate active multifaceted social decisions by individuals, and how natural selection could act on this variation. We use simulations to assess how variation in simple social association rules between individuals can determine their positions within emerging social networks. Our results show that metrics of individuals' indirect connections can be more strongly related to underlying simple social differences than metrics of their dyadic connections. External influences causing network noise (typical of animal social networks) generally inflated these differences. The findings demonstrate that relationships between complex network positions and other behaviours or fitness components do not provide sufficient evidence for the presence, or importance, of complex social behaviours, even if direct network metrics provide less explanatory power than indirect ones. Interestingly however, a plausible and straightforward heritable basis for complex network positions can arise from simple social differences, which in turn creates potential for selection to act on indirect connections.},

	abstract = {Hurricanes can bring about dramatic changes to ecosystems and adversely affect animals that live in them. We monitored behavioral responses in wild spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi yucatanensis) in the aftermath of two hurricanes (Emily and Wilma) that moved through the Yucatan peninsula in 2005. We predicted that the monkeys would shift their diets depending on relative food availability and experience a change in the distribution of activity patterns. Because spider monkeys’ social organization is characterized by a high degree of fission–fusion dynamics, we predicted they would form smaller subgroups subsequent to the hurricanes to mitigate competition over limited food resources. We compared their responses in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Emily and across the dry seasons before and after both hurricanes, to control for seasonal changes, by examining their activity budgets, foods consumed, and subgrouping dynamics. In the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Emily spider monkeys spent less time moving and more time feeding on leaves than before the hurricane and they were in smaller subgroups. In the dry season after both hurricanes the monkeys spent more time resting and less time moving than before the hurricanes, and leaves replaced fruit as their primary food resource. They fused into larger subgroups less often and had smaller subgroup sizes in the dry season after than before the hurricanes. Thus, the high degree of fission–fusion dynamics of spider monkeys was instrumental in affording the behavioral flexibility critical to cope with the negative post-hurricane consequences.},

	abstract = {Though the harmful effects anthropogenic disturbances pose to wild primates are well appreciated, comparatively little is known about the effects of natural disturbances. From December 2010 to January 2011, different mortality patterns were observed for two primate species, capuchins and howler monkeys, on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Unusually high rainfall in 2010 was associated with census and cadaver data indicating the rapid loss of {\textgreater}70\% of the capuchin population in late 2010 to early 2011. In contrast, over this same period, no decline was documented for howler monkeys and cadaver data for howlers was unexceptional. The high mortality experienced by the capuchin population was unexpected and its extent was not fully appreciated until the event was largely over. Explanations proposed for it included effects of hypothermia, disease or a shortage of some essential nutrient(s). Of these, the dietary explanation seems most probable. BCI capuchins depend most heavily on arthropod foods in December, when few higher quality ripe fruits are available. The unprecedented high rainfall in December 2010 is hypothesized to have largely eliminated the arthropod peak expected on BCI each December. A lack of protein-rich arthropods, when coupled with the climatic and nutritional stress capuchins generally experience at this time of year, appears to have precipitated the rapid die-off of most of the island's capuchin population. As howler monkeys obtain dietary protein primarily from leaves, a shortage of edible arthropods would not affect howler numbers. Comparison of our 2010 data with similar data on earlier primate/mammalian mortality events reported for BCI and for Corcovado, Costa Rica indicates that our understanding of the effects of natural disturbances on wild primate populations is not profound. We suggest that more research be devoted to this increasingly timely topic, so important to conservation policy. Am. J. Primatol. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {People are an inescapable aspect of most environments inhabited by nonhuman primates today. Consequently, interest has grown in how primates adjust their behavior to live in anthropogenic habitats. However, our understanding of primate behavioral flexibility and the degree to which it will enable primates to survive alongside people in the long term remains limited. This Special Issue brings together a collection of papers that extend our knowledge of this subject. In this introduction, we first review the literature to identify past and present trends in research and then introduce the contributions to this Special Issue. Our literature review confirms that publications on primate behavior in anthropogenic habitats, including interactions with people, increased markedly since the 2000s. Publications concern a diversity of primates but include only 17\% of currently recognized species, with certain primates overrepresented in studies, e.g., chimpanzees and macaques. Primates exhibit behavioral flexibility in anthropogenic habitats in various ways, most commonly documented as dietary adjustments, i.e., incorporation of human foods including agricultural crops and provisioned items, and as differences in activity, ranging, grouping patterns, and social organization, associated with changing anthropogenic factors. Publications are more likely to include information on negative rather than positive or neutral interactions between humans and primates. The contributions to this Special Issue include both empirical research and reviews that examine various aspects of the human–primate interface. Collectively, they show that primate behavior in shared landscapes does not always conflict with human interests, and demonstrate the value of examining behavior from a cost–benefit perspective without making prior assumptions concerning the nature of interactions. Careful interdisciplinary research has the potential to greatly improve our understanding of the complexities of human–primate interactions, and is crucial for identifying appropriate mechanisms to enable sustainable human–primate coexistence in the 21st century and beyond.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are numerical tools that combine observations of species occurrence or abundance with environmental estimates. They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in “established use.” Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Understanding the ecological interactions between plant reproductive strategies and frugivore feeding behavior can offer insight into the maintenance of tropical forest biodiversity. We examined the role of plant ecological and phenological characteristics in influencing fruit consumption by the White-bearded gibbon (Hylobates albibarbis) in Gunung Palung National Park, Indonesian Borneo. Gibbons are widespread across Borneo, highly frugivorous and perform important seed dispersal services. We compare multiple models using information criteria to identify the ecological and phenological predictors that most strongly influence gibbon fruit use of 154 plant genera. The most important predictors of resource use were the overall abundance of a genus and the consistency of fruit availability. Plant genera can maintain constant fruit availability as a result of (1) individual stems fruiting often or (2) stems fruiting out of synchrony with each other (asynchrony). Our results demonstrate that gibbons prefer to feed on plant genera that provide consistent fruit availability due to fruiting asynchrony. Because gibbons feed more often on genera that fruit asynchronously, gibbons are more likely to disperse seeds of plant genera with this reproductive strategy. Research on other frugivorous species is needed to determine whether the results for gibbons are generalizable more broadly. Finally, these results suggest that asynchronously fruiting plant genera may be particularly important for habitat restoration in tropical forests designed for frugivore conservation.},

Population surveys in 1998 and 2006 caused us to question our assumptions and to re-evaluate our long-term data set from a post hoc perspective. We first identified all animals observed or captured as adults in more than one non-natal group anywhere in the population. We then systematically analyzed joining or leaving by adults in seven groups tracked for various times from 1975 to 2005 for patterns suggesting secondary transfer. Fourteen adults (nine females, five males) were found in two different non-natal groups as adults. In addition, one male and one female that became dominant and reproduced in their natal group later transferred to a second group, and one female was known to be a tertiary transfer. Data from the seven tracked social groups indicate that 35\% of all the males and 29\% of all the females were potential secondary transfers. In these groups, males leaving or joining was not associated with group size or absolute number of females. Females leaving or joining was not associated with group size or absolute number of males, but females left groups with more females and joined groups with fewer females. Both sexes left groups with unfavorable sex ratios for their sex and joined groups with sex ratios more favorable for their sex. Since a favorable sex ratio is associated with reproductive success in other howler populations, this suggests secondary transfer as a reproductive strategy. Other factors could also influence secondary transfer.},

	abstract = {The oft-repeated claim that Earth’s biota is entering a sixth “mass extinction” depends on clearly demonstrating that current extinction rates are far above the “background” rates prevailing between the five previous mass extinctions. Earlier estimates of extinction rates have been criticized for using assumptions that might overestimate the severity of the extinction crisis. We assess, using extremely conservative assumptions, whether human activities are causing a mass extinction. First, we use a recent estimate of a background rate of 2 mammal extinctions per 10,000 species per 100 years (that is, 2 E/MSY), which is twice as high as widely used previous estimates. We then compare this rate with the current rate of mammal and vertebrate extinctions. The latter is conservatively low because listing a species as extinct requires meeting stringent criteria. Even under our assumptions, which would tend to minimize evidence of an incipient mass extinction, the average rate of vertebrate species loss over the last century is up to 100 times higher than the background rate. Under the 2 E/MSY background rate, the number of species that have gone extinct in the last century would have taken, depending on the vertebrate taxon, between 800 and 10,000 years to disappear. These estimates reveal an exceptionally rapid loss of biodiversity over the last few centuries, indicating that a sixth mass extinction is already under way. Averting a dramatic decay of biodiversity and the subsequent loss of ecosystem services is still possible through intensified conservation efforts, but that window of opportunity is rapidly closing.
Humans are causing a massive animal extinction without precedent in 65 million years.

	abstract = {Examination of phenological patterns of tropical trees at different temporal and spatial scales can elucidate biotic and abiotic factors that correlate with fruiting, flowering and/or leaf set patterns. In this study, 3793 trees from 104 species in Kibale National Park, Uganda were monitored. The trees were selected from two sites (Kanyawara and Ngogo) separated by 10 km. Trees were monitored monthly to document community-wide and population-level fruiting and flowering patterns for a maximum of 76 mo. Analysis of two sites over a number of years permitted examination of generalities of patterns found on smaller spatial and temporal scales. Spectral analysis indicated that community-level flowering and fruiting at Kanyawara exhibited regular annual peaks, although the flowering peaks were of shorter duration. At Ngogo, community-level flowering also displayed regular annual peaks, but fruiting had an irregular pattern with no distinct peaks. The abundance of fruiting trees at Kanyawara was negatively related to the minimum temperature in the previous season (3-7 mo prior). Since fruiting tended to peak when the first wet season of the year was ending and the dry season was beginning, this suggests that the minimum temperature in the previous dry season is important in determining how many individuals fruit. Flowering at Kanyawara peaked immediately after the maximum annual period of high irradiance. Within-species synchronization was evident in the flowering for all species examined at Ngogo and for 64\% of those at Kanyawara. Fruiting was synchronous within species for 64\% of the species at both sites. Despite this general community-level synchronization, the months of peak fruiting and flowering for some species varied markedly among years. Furthermore, for a number of species the timing of fruiting or flowering events differed between Kanyawara and Ngogo. For some species, trends that were suggested from one year of data were not supported when additional years were considered. Although these two sites are close together, share many of the same species, and experience similar climatic regimes, many phenological patterns were site-dependent.},

Silver-spoon effects, when environmental quality at birth improves future performance regardless of the adult environment, can induce strong lagged responses on population growth. Alternatively, the external predictive adaptive response (PAR) hypothesis predicts that organisms will adjust their developmental trajectory and physiology during early life in anticipation of expected adult conditions but has rarely been assessed in wild species. We used over 40 years of detailed individual monitoring of bighorn ewes (Ovis canadensis) to quantify long-term cohort effects on survival and reproduction. We then tested both the silver-spoon and the PAR hypotheses. Cohort effects involved a strong interaction between birth and current environments: reproduction and survival were lowest for ewes that were born and lived at high population densities. This interaction, however, does not support the PAR hypothesis because individuals with matching high-density birth and adult environments had reduced fitness. Instead, individuals born at high density had overall lower lifetime fitness suggesting a silver-spoon effect. Early-life conditions can induce long-term changes in fitness components, and their effects on cohort fitness vary according to adult environment.},

	abstract = {Convergent evidence from many species reveals the evolutionary origins of human friendship. In horses, elephants, hyenas, dolphins, monkeys, and chimpanzees, some individuals form friendships that last for years. Bonds occur among females, among males, or between males and females. Genetic relatedness affects friendships. In species where males disperse, friendships are more likely among females. If females disperse, friendships are more likely among males. Not all friendships, however, depend on kinship; many are formed between unrelated individuals. Friendships often involve cooperative interactions that are separated in time. They depend, at least in part, on the memory and emotions associated with past interactions. Applying the term “friendship” to animals is not anthropomorphic: Many studies have shown that the animals themselves recognize others' relationships. Friendships are adaptive. Male allies have superior competitive ability and improved reproductive success; females with the strongest, most enduring friendships experience less stress, higher infant survival, and live longer.},

Whilst studies show that differences in centrality exist in animal networks with central individuals having higher fitness, network efficiency has never been studied in animal groups. Here we studied 78 groups of primates (24 species). We found that group size and neocortex ratio were correlated with network efficiency. Centralisation (whether several individuals are central in the group) and modularity (how a group is clustered) had opposing effects on network efficiency, showing that tolerant species have more efficient networks. Such network properties affecting individual fitness could be shaped by natural selection. Our results are in accordance with the social brain and cultural intelligence hypotheses, which suggest that the importance of network efficiency and information flow through social learning relates to cognitive abilities.},

	abstract = {Agonism is common in group-living animals, shaping dominance relationships and ultimately impacting individual fitness. Rates of agonism vary considerably among taxa, however, and explaining this variation has been central in ecological models of female social relationships in primates. Early iterations of these models posited a link to diet, with more frequent agonism predicted in frugivorous species due to the presumed greater contestability of fruits relative to other food types. Although some more recent studies have suggested that dietary categories may be poor predictors of contest competition among primates, to date there have been no broad, cross-taxa comparisons of rates of female–female agonism in relation to diet. This study tests whether dietary variables do indeed predict rates of female agonism and further investigates the role of group size (i.e., number of competitors) and substrate use (i.e., degree of arboreality) on the frequency of agonism. Data from 44 wild, unprovisioned groups, including 3 strepsirhine species, 3 platyrrhines, 5 colobines, 10 cercopithecines, and 2 hominoids were analyzed using phylogenetically controlled and uncontrolled methods. Results indicate that diet does not predict agonistic rates, with trends actually being in the opposite direction than predicted for all taxa except cercopithecines. In contrast, agonistic rates are positively associated with group size and possibly degree of terrestriality. Competitor density and perhaps the risk of fighting, thus, appear more important than general diet in predicting agonism among female primates. We discuss the implications of these results for socio-ecological hypotheses.},

The effects of sociality on infant survival are independent of the effects of dominance rank, group membership, and environmental conditions. Our results are consistent with the evidence that social support has beneficial effects on human health and well-being across the life span.

	abstract = {Food distribution is hypothesized to be important in determining the nature of female relationships within social groups of primates. When food limits female reproductive success, spatially clumped foods are expected to produce strong, linear dominance hierarchies within groups, whereas more spatially dispersed foods are expected to produce weaker or non-existent dominance hierarchies. The association between food distribution and competitive relationships presumably occurs because clumped foods are usurpable but dispersed foods are not. We examined the spatial distribution of food patches (trees) and patch size relative to feeding behavior and agonistic interactions in vervets and patas monkeys, two closely related and sympatric species that nonetheless differ in the strength of the female dominance hierarchy. Food patches of both patas monkeys and vervets were small in size and randomly distributed in Acacia drepanolobium habitat. In contrast, in A. xanthophloea woodland, the habitat type that was exclusively used by vervets, food patches were larger and more spatially clumped. These similarities and differences between and within species were correlated with similarities and differences in the strength and linearity of their dominance hierarchies. Patas monkeys and vervets in A. drepanolobium habitat had dominance hierarchies that were weakly defined because there were relatively few agonistic interactions between females. By contrast, in A. xanthophloea habitat, vervets had a stronger, linear dominance hierarchy characterized by a higher rate of agonistic interactions over food. The covariation of agonistic interactions with patch size is discussed in relation to depletion time, another characteristic that may covary with food distribution, and resource renewal rate, an important determinant of agonistic interactions in insectivorous birds, fishes, insects, and mammals.},

	abstract = {Variability selection (abbreviated as VS) is a process considered to link adaptive change to large degrees of environment variability. Its application to hominid evolution is based, in part, on the pronounced rise in environmental remodeling that took place over the past several million years. The VS hypothesis differs from prior views of hominid evolution, which stress the consistent selective effects associated with specific habitats or directional trends (e.g., woodland, savanna expansion, cooling). According to the VS hypothesis, wide fluctuations over time created a growing disparity in adaptive conditions. Inconsistency in selection eventually caused habitat-specific adaptations to be replaced by structures and behaviors responsive to complex environmental change. Key hominid adaptations, in fact, emerged during times of heightened variability. Early bipedality, encephalized brains, and complex human sociality appear to signify a sequence of VS adaptations—i.e., a ratcheting up of versatility and responsiveness to novel environments experienced over the past 6 million years. The adaptive results of VS cannot be extrapolated from selection within a single environmental shift or relatively stable habitat. If some complex traits indeed require disparities in adaptive setting (and relative fitness) in order to evolve, the VS idea counters the prevailing view that adaptive change necessitates long-term, directional consistency in selection. © 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Yet, despite 30 years of evolutionary anthropological interest in the determinants of fitness, there exist few principled investigations of the diverse sources of wealth that might reveal selective forces during recent human history. To develop a more holistic understanding of how selection shapes human phenotypic traits, be these transmitted by genetic or cultural means, we expand the conventional focus on associations between socioeconomic status and fitness to three distinct types of wealth—embodied, material and relational. Using a model selection approach to the study of women's success in raising offspring in an African horticultural population (the Tanzanian Pimbwe), we find that the top performing models consistently include relational and material wealth, with embodied wealth as a less reliable predictor. Specifically, child mortality risk is increased with few household assets, parent nonresidency, child legitimacy, and one or more parents having been accused of witchcraft. The use of multiple models to test various hypotheses greatly facilitates systematic comparative analyses of human behavioural diversity in wealth accrual and investment across different kinds of societies.},

We therefore emphasize the need to tie discussions of human cooperation to the natural history of our species and its closest relatives, focusing on behavioral contexts best suited to reveal underlying selection pressures and evolved decision rules. Food sharing is a fundamental form of cooperation that is well-studied across primates and is particularly noteworthy because of its central role in shaping evolved human life history, social organization, and cooperative psychology. Here we synthesize available evidence on food sharing in humans and other primates, tracing the origins of offspring provisioning, mutualism, trade, and reciprocity throughout the primate order. While primates may gain some benefits from sharing, humans, faced with more collective action problems in a risky foraging niche, expanded on primate patterns to buffer risk and recruit mates and allies through reciprocity and signaling, and established co-evolving social norms of production and sharing. Differences in the necessity for sharing are reflected in differences in sharing psychology across species, thus helping to explain unique aspects of our evolved cooperative psychology.},

	abstract = {Objectives:

Previous research among foragers and theory suggests that nonmaternal caregivers offer essential assistance, which supports female reproduction and the costs associated with lengthy child development. Mothers' face trade-offs in energy allocation between work and childcare, particularly when mothers have an infant. These trade-offs likely have crucial impacts on the pace of reproduction and child health. Caregivers can help mothers with childcare or they can reduce a mother's nonchildcare workload. If caregivers assist mothers by substituting childcare, then maternal energy expenditure (EE) in other work activities should increase. If caregivers assist mothers by substituting labor, then maternal EE in work activities should decrease when caregivers are present.


Methods:

Utilizing detailed, quantitative behavioral observations and EE data, we test these propositions with data from 28 Aka forager mothers with children {\textless}35 months old. We isolate paternal, grandmaternal, and other caregiver effects on maternal EE and childcare in multivariate analyses.


Results:

Our results show that caregivers (largely grandmothers) significantly reduce mothers' work EE by as much 216 kcal across a 9-hour observation period, while fathers and juveniles appear to increase maternal EE. Direct childcare from grandmothers decreases maternal direct care by about one-to-one indicating a labor substitution. Direct childcare from fathers decreases maternal care by almost 4 to 1, resulting in a net reduction of total direct care from all caregivers.


Conclusions:

Our results indicate that there are multiple pathways by which helpers offset maternal work/childcare trade-offs. Am. J. Hum. Biol., 2013. © 2012Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In this paper, we propose that task specialization between female kin might also play an important role in women’s social and economic strategies. We use historic group composition data from a population of Western Desert Martu Aborigines to show how women maintained access to same-sex kin over the lifespan. Our results show that adult women had more same-sex kin and more closely related kin present than adult men, and they retained these links after marriage. Maternal co-residence was more prevalent for married women than for married men, and there is evidence that mothers may be strategizing to live with daughters at critical intervals—early in their reproductive careers and when they do not have other close female kin in the group. The maintenance of female kin networks across the lifespan allows for the possibility of cooperative breeding as well as an all-female division of labor.},

Here, we present the first exploration in humans of the relationship between reproductive success and different measures of network centrality of 39 Agta and 38 BaYaka mothers. We collected three-meter contact (‘proximity’) networks and reproductive histories to test the prediction that individual centrality is positively associated with reproductive fitness (number of living offspring). Rather than direct social ties influencing reproductive success, mothers with greater indirect centrality (i.e. centrality determined by second and third degree ties) produced significantly more living offspring. However, indirect centrality is also correlated with sickness in the Agta, suggesting a trade-off. In complex social species, the optimisation of individuals’ network position has important ramifications for fitness, potentially due to easy access to different parts of the network, facilitating cooperation and social influence in unpredictable ecologies.},

For deforested lands to have conservation value requires an understanding of regeneration rates of vegetation, the rates at which animals colonize and grow in regenerating areas, and the nature of interactions between plants and animals in the specific region. Here, we present data on forest regeneration and animal abundance at four regenerating sites that had reached the stage of closed canopy forest where the average dbh of the trees was 17 cm. Overall, 20.3 percent of stems were wind-dispersed species and 79.7 percent were animal-dispersed species, while in the old-growth forest 17.3 percent of the stems were wind-dispersed species. The regenerating forest supported a substantial primate population and encounter rate (groups per km walked) in the regenerating sites was high compared to the neighboring old-growth forests. By monitoring elephant tracks for 10 yr, we demonstrated that elephant numbers increased steadily over time, but they increased dramatically since 2004. In general, the richness of the mammal community detected by sight, tracks, feces, and/or camera traps, was high in regenerating forests compared to that documented for the national park. We conclude that in Africa, a continent that has seen dramatic declines in the area of old-growth forest, there is ample opportunity to reclaim degraded areas and quickly restore substantial animal populations.},

	abstract = {Disease risk is a potential cost of group living. Although modular organization is thought to reduce this cost in animal societies, empirical evidence toward this hypothesis has been conflicting. We analyzed empirical social networks from 43 animal species to motivate our study of the epidemiological consequences of modular structure in animal societies. From these empirical studies, we identified the features of interaction patterns associated with network modularity and developed a theoretical network model to investigate when and how subdivisions in social networks influence disease dynamics. Contrary to prior work, we found that disease risk is largely unaffected by modular structure, although social networks beyond a modular threshold experience smaller disease burden and longer disease duration. Our results illustrate that the lowering of disease burden in highly modular social networks is driven by two mechanisms of modular organization: network fragmentation and subgroup cohesion. Highly fragmented social networks with cohesive subgroups are able to structurally trap infections within a few subgroups and also cause a structural delay to the spread of disease outbreaks. Finally, we show that network models incorporating modular structure are necessary only when prior knowledge suggests that interactions within the population are highly subdivided. Otherwise, null networks based on basic knowledge about group size and local contact heterogeneity may be sufficient when data-limited estimates of epidemic consequences are necessary. Overall, our work does not support the hypothesis that modular structure universally mitigates the disease impact of group living.},

Theory predicts that interacting phenotypes, whereby an individual’s behavior depends on the behavior of its social partners, can drive such social assortment. We measured repeated indirect genetic effects (IGEs) during cooperative predator inspection in eight populations of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) that vary in their evolutionary history of predation. Four broad patterns emerged that were dependent on river, predation history, and sex: (i) current partner behavior had the largest effect on focal behavior, with fish from low-predation habitats responding more to their social partners than fish from high-predation habitats; (ii) different focal/partner behavior combinations can generate cooperation; (iii) some high-predation fish exhibited carryover effects across social partners; and (iv) high-predation fish were more risk averse. These results provide the first large-scale comparison of interacting phenotypes during cooperation across wild animal populations, highlighting the potential importance of IGEs in maintaining cooperation. Intriguingly, while focal fish responded strongly to current social partners, carryover effects between social partners suggest generalized reciprocity (in which one helps anyone if helped by someone) may contribute to the evolution of cooperation in some, but not all, populations of guppies.},

Social grooming is thought to be the means by which females ensure support from other individuals, either by the direct exchange of grooming for aid or by using grooming as a means of strengthening social bonds. Since these relationships are valuable, they must be regularly serviced and must be repaired if they become damaged. We question this position and show that empirical evidence to support these theoretical arguments is lacking. We then go on to present a new framework in which the inconsistencies regarding grooming and relationship negotiation are interpreted in the context of individual decision-making processes. In this framework, primate groups represent biological markets in which individuals either trade grooming in a reciprocal manner for the direct benefits that grooming itself offers, or exchange it for tolerance by more powerful animals. A number of testable predictions are derived from this hypotheses. The need for socioecological studies to focus on the dynamics of individual relationships rather than using summary measures is emphasized since only a detailed knowledge of serial interaction will provide the key to understanding the complexities of individual decision-making processes.},

We argue that that there is now a need to refocus attention on the bonding processes that give rise to social groups.

Primate social systems are remarkably diverse, and thus play a central role in understanding social evolution, including the biological origin of human societies. Although baboons have been prominently featured in this context, historically little was known about the westernmost member of the genus, the Guinea baboon (Papio papio).


Material and Methods

Here, we summarize the findings from the first years of observations at the field site CRP Simenti in the Niokolo Koba National Park in Senegal.


Results

Guinea baboons reveal a nested multi-level social organization, with reproductive units comprising one “primary” male, one to several females, young, and occasionally “secondary” males at the base of the society. Three to five units form “parties,” which team up with other parties to form a “gang.” Different gangs have largely overlapping home ranges and agonistic interactions between different parties or gangs are rare. Some but not all strongly socially bonded males are highly related, and population genetic and behavioral evidence indicate female-biased dispersal. Females play an important role in intersexual bond formation and maintenance, and female tenure length varies between a few weeks to several years.


Discussion

While the social organization resembles that of hamadryas baboons (P. hamadryas), the social structure differs considerably, specifically in terms of low male aggressiveness and female freedom. Despite substantial differences in social organization and social structure, the acoustic structure of Guinea baboon vocalizations does not differ substantially from that of other baboon taxa. With its multi-level organization, stable bonds between males and females, as well as a high-degree of male-male cooperation and tolerance, Guinea baboons constitute an intriguing model for reconstructing human social evolution.},

	abstract = {Most mammals live in social groups in which members form differentiated social relationships. Individuals may vary in their degree of sociality, and this variation can be associated with differential fitness. In some species, for example, female sociality has a positive effect on infant survival. However, investigations of such cases are still rare, and no previous study has considered how male infanticide might constrain effects of female sociality on infant survival. Infanticide is part of the male reproductive strategy in many mammals, and it has the potential to override, or even reverse, effects of female reproductive strategies, including sociality. Therefore, we investigated the relationships between female sociality, offspring survival, and infanticide risk in wild white-faced capuchin monkeys using long-term data from Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. Female capuchins formed differentiated bonds, and bond strength was predicted by kin relationship, rank difference, and the presence of female infants. Most females formed stable bonds with their top social partners, although bond stability varied considerably. Offspring of highly social females, who were often high-ranking females, exhibited higher survivorship during stable periods compared with offspring of less social females. However, offspring of highly social females were more likely to die or disappear during periods of alpha male replacements, probably because new alpha males are central to the group, and therefore more likely to target the infants of highly social, central females. This study shows that female sociality in mammals can have negative fitness consequences that are imposed by male behavior.},

	abstract = {Background Exploration of the cognitive systems underlying human friendship will be advanced by identifying the evolved functions these systems perform. Here we propose that human friendship is caused, in part, by cognitive mechanisms designed to assemble support groups for potential conflicts. We use game theory to identify computations about friends that can increase performance in multi-agent conflicts. This analysis suggests that people would benefit from: 1) ranking friends, 2) hiding friend-ranking, and 3) ranking friends according to their own position in partners' rankings. These possible tactics motivate the hypotheses that people possess egocentric and allocentric representations of the social world, that people are motivated to conceal this information, and that egocentric friend-ranking is determined by allocentric representations of partners' friend-rankings (more than others' traits).  Methodology/Principal Findings We report results from three studies that confirm predictions derived from the alliance hypothesis. Our main empirical finding, replicated in three studies, was that people's rankings of their ten closest friends were predicted by their own perceived rank among their partners' other friends. This relationship remained strong after controlling for a variety of factors such as perceived similarity, familiarity, and benefits.  Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that the alliance hypothesis merits further attention as a candidate explanation for human friendship.},

	abstract = {Cooking is a human universal that must have had widespread effects on the nutrition, ecology, and social relationships of the species that invented it. The location and timing of its origins are unknown, but it should have left strong signals in the fossil record. We suggest that such signals are detectable at ca. 1.9 million years ago in the reduced digestive effort (e.g., smaller teeth) and increased supply of food energy (e.g., larger female body mass) of early Homo erectus. The adoption of cooking required delay of the consumption of food while it was accumulated and/or brought to a processing area, and accumulations of food were valuable and stealable. Dominant (e.g., larger) individuals (typically male) were therefore able to scrounge from subordinate (e.g., smaller) individuals (typically female) instead of relying on their own foraging efforts. Because female fitness is limited by access to resources (particularly energetic resources), this dynamic would have favored females able to minimize losses to theft. To do so, we suggest, females formed protective relationships with male co‐defenders. Males would have varied in their ability or willingness to engage effectively in this relationship, so females would have competed for the best food guards, partly by extending their period of sexual attractiveness. This would have increased the numbers of matings per pregnancy, reducing the intensity of male intrasexual competition. Consequently, there was reduced selection for males to be relatively large. This scenario is supported by the fossil record, which indicates that the relative body size of males fell only once in hominid evolution, around the time when H. erectus evolved. Therefore we suggest that cooking was responsible for the evolution of the unusual human social system in which pair bonds are embedded within multifemale, multimale communities and supported by strong mutual and frequently conflicting sexual interest.},

It is also probably the case that the most significant and divergent of these differences relate to our social behaviour and its underlying cognition, as much as to fundamental differences in physiology, biochemistry or anatomy. In this paper, we first attempt to demarcate what are the principal differences between human and other societies in terms of social structure, organization and relationships, so that we can identify what derived features require explanation. We then consider the evidence of the archaeological and fossil record, to determine the most probable context in time and taxonomy, of these evolutionary trends. Finally, we attempt to link five major transitional points in hominin evolution to the selective context in which they occurred, and to use the principles of behavioural ecology to understand their ecological basis. Critical changes in human social organization relate to the development of a larger scale of fission and fusion; the development of a greater degree of nested substructures within the human community; and the development of intercommunity networks. The underlying model that we develop is that the evolution of ‘human society’ is underpinned by ecological factors, but these are influenced as much by technological and behavioural innovations as external environmental change.},

	abstract = {Animal Culture
Cultural transmission of information occurs when individuals learn from others with more experience or when individuals come to accept particular modes of behavior as the local norm. Such information transfer can be expected in highly social or long-lived species where contact and time for learning are maximized and are seen in humans (see the Perspective by de Waal). Using a network-based diffusion analysis on a long-term data set that includes tens of thousands of observations of individual humpback whales, Allen et al. (p. 485) show that an innovative feeding behavior has spread through social transmission since it first emerged in a single individual in 1980. The “lobtail” feeding has passed among associating individuals for more than three decades. Van de Waal et al. (p. 483), on the other hand, used a controlled experimental approach in vervet monkeys to show that individuals learn what to eat from more experienced individuals within their social group. Not only did young animals learn from observing older animals, but immigrating males switched their food preference to that of their new group.
Conformity to local behavioral norms reflects the pervading role of culture in human life. Laboratory experiments have begun to suggest a role for conformity in animal social learning, but evidence from the wild remains circumstantial. Here, we show experimentally that wild vervet monkeys will abandon personal foraging preferences in favor of group norms new to them. Groups first learned to avoid the bitter-tasting alternative of two foods. Presentations of these options untreated months later revealed that all new infants naïve to the foods adopted maternal preferences. Males who migrated between groups where the alternative food was eaten switched to the new local norm. Such powerful effects of social learning represent a more potent force than hitherto recognized in shaping group differences among wild animals.
A natural experiment reveals that wild vervet migrants adopt local norms when it comes to choosing foods. [Also see Perspective by de Waal]

Here, we show that this similarity extends to genotypes. Across the whole genome, friends’ genotypes at the single nucleotide polymorphism level tend to be positively correlated (homophilic). In fact, the increase in similarity relative to strangers is at the level of fourth cousins. However, certain genotypes are also negatively correlated (heterophilic) in friends. And the degree of correlation in genotypes can be used to create a “friendship score” that predicts the existence of friendship ties in a hold-out sample. A focused gene-set analysis indicates that some of the overall correlation in genotypes can be explained by specific systems; for example, an olfactory gene set is homophilic and an immune system gene set is heterophilic, suggesting that these systems may play a role in the formation or maintenance of friendship ties. Friends may be a kind of “functional kin.” Finally, homophilic genotypes exhibit significantly higher measures of positive selection, suggesting that, on average, they may yield a synergistic fitness advantage that has been helping to drive recent human evolution.},

Rhesus macaques experience variable levels of stress on the basis of their position in the social hierarchy. To examine how stress affects immune function, Snyder-Mackler et al. manipulated the social status of individual macaques (see the Perspective by Sapolsky). Social status influenced the immune system at multiple levels, from immune cell numbers to gene expression, and altered signaling pathways in a model of response to infection. Macaques possess a plastic and adaptive immune response wherein social subordination promotes antibacterial responses, whereas high social status promotes antiviral responses.
Science, this issue p. 1041; see also p. 967
Social status is one of the strongest predictors of human disease risk and mortality, and it also influences Darwinian fitness in social mammals more generally. To understand the biological basis of these effects, we combined genomics with a social status manipulation in female rhesus macaques to investigate how status alters immune function. We demonstrate causal but largely plastic social status effects on immune cell proportions, cell type–specific gene expression levels, and the gene expression response to immune challenge. Further, we identify specific transcription factor signaling pathways that explain these differences, including low-status–associated polarization of the Toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway toward a proinflammatory response. Our findings provide insight into the direct biological effects of social inequality on immune function, thus improving our understanding of social gradients in health.

	abstract = {The scale of human cooperation is an evolutionary puzzle. All of the available evidence suggests that the societies of our Pliocene ancestors were like those of other social primates, and this means that human psychology has changed in ways that support larger, more cooperative societies that characterize modern humans. In this paper, we argue that cultural adaptation is a key factor in these changes. Over the last million years or so, people evolved the ability to learn from each other, creating the possibility of cumulative, cultural evolution. Rapid cultural adaptation also leads to persistent differences between local social groups, and then competition between groups leads to the spread of behaviours that enhance their competitive ability. Then, in such culturally evolved cooperative social environments, natural selection within groups favoured genes that gave rise to new, more pro-social motives. Moral systems enforced by systems of sanctions and rewards increased the reproductive success of individuals who functioned well in such environments, and this in turn led to the evolution of other regarding motives like empathy and social emotions like shame.},

	abstract = {We use two novel techniques to analyze association patterns in a group of wild spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) studied continuously for 8 years. Permutation tests identified association rates higher or lower than chance expectation, indicating active processes of companionship and avoidance as opposed to passive aggregation. Network graphs represented individual adults as nodes and their association rates as weighted edges. Strength and eigenvector centrality (a measure of how strongly linked an individual is to other strongly linked individuals) were used to quantify the particular role of individuals in determining the network's structure. Female–female dyads showed higher association rates than any other type of dyad, but permutation tests revealed that these associations cannot be distinguished from random aggregation. Females formed tightly linked clusters that were stable over time, with the exception of immigrant females who showed little association with any adult in the group. Eigenvector centrality was higher for females than for males. Adult males were associated mostly among them, and although their strength of association with others was lower than that of females, their association rates revealed a process of active companionship. Female–male bonds were weaker than those between same-sex pairs, with the exception of those involving young male adults, who by virtue of their strong connections both with female and male adults, appear as temporary brokers between the female and male clusters of the network. This analytical framework can serve to develop a more complete explanation of social structure in species with high levels of fission–fusion dynamics.},

	abstract = {Species with greater expression of fission-fusion dynamics show greater variability in the size, composition, and cohesion of subgroups over time. This may allow their adjustment to local environmental, social, and demographic conditions. We tested which environmental and social factors influenced subgroup size in one such species, the black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata) at two sites within a fragmented forest landscape. Using instantaneous focal sampling at 15-min intervals, we collected data on subgroup size and composition, fruit and flower availability, and location. We also collected biweekly data on site-wide fruit and flower availability. We used these data to test the influence of season, food availability, reproduction, and predation risk on adult subgroup size in this species. Ruffed lemur adults consistently formed significantly larger subgroups in times of lower site-wide fruit availability, during the wet season, and when one or more infants were present. There were differences between sites in the relationship between subgroup size and tree size, fruit patch size, and site-wide flower availability. Variables measuring indirect predation risk showed no significant relationship with subgroup size. These results emphasize the strong relationship between fission-fusion dynamics and spatial and temporal variation in food availability, as well as the importance of sociality in a species with communal care of infants. Fission-fusion dynamics may serve as an evolutionary strategy to adapt to the unpredictable and sometimes harsh environmental conditions of Madagascar and may facilitate the persistence of communities of this critically endangered lemur despite widespread anthropogenic habitat modification.Significance statementFission-fusion dynamics (the joining and separating of subgroups within a larger group of animals) may allow species to adjust social benefits to changing environmental conditions. This study examines the underlying ecological and social factors that might influence fission-fusion dynamics in black-and-white ruffed lemurs. Subgroup size in this species was strongly related to food availability, though not always in the direction expected. This suggests that the relationship between food availability and sociality changes when food availability reaches very low levels. Additionally, infant presence was linked to larger adult subgroups, indicating a connection between fission-fusion behavior and the cooperative rearing of offspring seen in this species. Relationships between subgroup size and some environmental variables differed between sites, emphasizing the flexibility of grouping patterns in this species and indicating that local conditions may play a large role in the expression of fission-fusion dynamics.},

While the impact of bond strength is well studied, the consequences of bond predictability and equitability are often overlooked. Similarly, whether bonds reflect short-term contingencies and/or long-term social strategies remains understudied. We investigated these questions in female crested macaques, Macaca nigra, which display a tolerant social style within a nepotistic hierarchical social structure. We analysed the structure of social bonds by testing whether similarity within dyads (in kinship, dominance and age) predicted the strength, predictability and equitability of bonds. We then tested the value of social bonds by analysing the effect of their characteristics on three fitness-related behaviours: coalitionary support, feeding-in-proximity and aggression. We found that the bond characteristics of females differed substantially from those of other species with comparable data: bonds were of average strength, of moderate endurance and relatively balanced. Stronger bonds were more equitable but less predictable than weaker bonds. Closely ranked females, but not kin or age peers, had stronger, more predictable and more equitable bonds than others. Coalitionary support was not related to any of the bond characteristics, feeding-in-proximity was positively associated with strength and predictability and aggression was positively linked to strength and negatively to equitability. These results highlight the complex picture of the benefits of social bonds in this species. They reflect the degrees of freedom tolerant macaque females can express in their social relationships within their stable social structure, a pattern that may not be given enough consideration in stable nepotistic hierarchical societies. Comparative research is necessary to establish whether these patterns are more general than previously thought or a specific feature of tolerant macaques. Investigating various characteristics of bonds together is paramount to appreciate the dynamics of social relationships and to better understand the social components of fitness.},

So far most of the studies rely on the analyses of various network snapshots, but do not capture changes over time. Here we use a stochastic actor-oriented model (SAOM) to test both the structure and the dynamics of relationships of three groups of wild vervet monkeys. We found that triadic closure (i.e., the friend of a friend is a friend) was significant in all three groups while degree popularity (i.e., the willingness to associate with individuals with high degree of connections) was significant in only two groups (AK, BD). The structure and dynamics of relationships according to the attributes of sex, matrilineand age differed significantly among groups. With respect to the structure, when analyzing the likelihood of bonds according to the different attributes, we found that individuals associate themselves preferably to individuals of the same sex only in two groups (AK, NH), while significant results for attachment to individuals of the same matriline were found also in two groups (BD, NH). With respect to the dynamics, i.e., how quickly relationships are modified, we found in two groups (AK, BD) that females' relationships were more prone to variation than males.' In the BD group, relationships within high-ranking matrilines were less stable than low-ranking ones while in the NH group, juveniles' relationships were also less stable than adults' ones. The intergroup variation indicates that establishing species-specific or even population specific characteristics of social networks for later between-species comparisons will be challenging. Although, such variation could also indicate some methodological issue, we are quite confident that data was collected similarly within the different groups. Our study therefore provides a potential new method to quantify social complexity according to natural demographic variation.},

	abstract = {In social groups, individuals' dominance rank, social bonds, and kinship with other group members have been shown to influence their foraging behavior. However, there is growing evidence that the particular effects of these social traits may also depend on local environmental conditions. We investigated this by comparing the foraging behavior of wild chacma baboons, Papio ursinus, under natural conditions and in a field experiment where food was spatially clumped. Data were collected from 55 animals across two troops over a 5-month period, including over 900 agonistic foraging interactions and over 600 food patch visits in each condition. In both conditions, low-ranked individuals received more agonism, but this only translated into reduced foraging performances for low-ranked individuals in the high-competition experimental conditions. Our results suggest one possible reason for this pattern may be low-ranked individuals strategically investing social effort to negotiate foraging tolerance, but the rank-offsetting effect of this investment being overwhelmed in the higher-competition experimental environment. Our results also suggest that individuals may use imbalances in their social bonds to negotiate tolerance from others under a wider range of environmental conditions, but utilize the overall strength of their social bonds in more extreme environments where feeding competition is more intense. These findings highlight that behavioral tactics such as the strategic investment of social effort may allow foragers to mitigate the costs of low rank, but that the effectiveness of these tactics is likely to be limited in certain environments.},

While there is growing recognition of the importance of strong bonds that persist for years, social relationships can also vary over weeks and months, suggesting that social strategies may be optimized over shorter timescales. Using biological market theory as a framework, we explore whether temporal variation in the benefits of social relationships might be sufficient to generate daily adjustments of social strategies in wild baboons. Data on grooming, one measure of social relationships, were collected from 60 chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) across two troops over a six month period. Our analyses suggest that social strategies can show diurnal variation, with subordinates preferentially grooming more dominant individuals earlier in the day compared with later in the day. These findings indicate that group-living animals may optimize certain elements of their social strategies over relatively short time periods.},

	abstract = {Although many studies have analyzed the causes and consequences of social relationships, few studies have explicitly assessed how measures of social relationships are affected by the choice of behaviors used to quantify them. The use of many behaviors to measure social relationships in primates has long been advocated, but it was analytically difficult to implement this framework into primatological work. However, recent advances in social network analysis (SNA) now allow the comparison of multiple networks created from different behaviors. Here we use our database of baboon social behavior (Papio anubis, Gashaka Gumti National Park, Nigeria) to investigate (i) to what extent social networks created from different behaviors overlap, (ii) to what extent individuals occupy similar social positions in these networks and (iii) how sex affects social network position in this population of baboons. We used data on grooming, aggression, displacement, mounting and presenting, which were collected over a 15-month period. We calculated network parameters separately for each behavior. Networks based on displacement, mounting and presenting were very similar to each other, whereas grooming and aggression networks differed both from each other and from mounting, displacement and presenting networks. Overall, individual network positions were strongly affected by sex. Individuals central in one network tended to be central in most other networks as well, whereas other measures such as clustering coefficient were found to vary depending on the behavior analyzed. Thus, our results suggest that a baboon's social environment is best described by a multiplex network based on affiliative, aggressive and sexual behavior. Modern SNA provides a number of useful tools that will help us to better understand animals' social environment. We also discuss potential caveats related to their use. Am. J.

	abstract = {To better understand how individual relationships influence patterns of social foraging in primate groups, we explored networks of co-feeding in wild desert baboons (Papio ursinus). To minimize the risk of aggression and injury associated with contest competition, we expected that individual group members would choose to co-feed with those group-mates that are most likely to show tolerance and a willingness to share food patches. We tested two alternative hypotheses about who those group-mates might be: the “social bonds hypothesis” predicts that preferred foraging partners will be those with whom individuals share strong social bonds, indexed by grooming, whereas the “kinship hypothesis” predicts that preferred foraging partners will be relatives. We also investigated and controlled for the effects of dominance rank, given that competitive ability is known to shape foraging patterns. Social network analyses of over 5,000 foraging events for 14 adults in a single troop revealed that baboon co-feeding was significantly correlated with grooming relationships but not genetic relatedness, and this finding was also true of the female-only co-feeding network. Dominant individuals were also found to be central to the co-feeding network, frequently sharing food patches with multiple group-mates. This polyadic analysis of foraging associations between individuals underlines the importance of dominance and affiliation to patterns of primate social foraging. Am. J.

	abstract = {Even though female food acquisition is an area of considerable interest in hunter-gatherer research, the ecological determinants of women’s economic decisions in these populations are still poorly understood. The literature on female foraging behavior indicates that there is considerable variation within and across foraging societies in the amount of time that women spend foraging and in the amount and types of food that they acquire. It is possible that this heterogeneity reflects variation in the trade-offs between time spent in food acquisition and child care activities that women face in different groups of hunter-gatherers. In this paper we discuss the fitness trade-offs between food acquisition and child care that Hiwi and Ache women foragers might face. Multiple regression analyses show that in both populations the daily food acquisition of a woman’s spouse is negatively related to female foraging effort. In addition, nursing mothers spend less time foraging and acquire less food than do nonnursing women. As the number of dependents that a woman has increases, however, women also increase foraging time and the amount of food they acquire. Some interesting exceptions to these general trends are as follows: (a) differences in foraging effort between nursing and nonnursing women are less pronounced when fruits and roots are in season than in other seasons of the year; (b) foraging return rates decrease for Ache women as their numbers of dependents increase; and (c) among Ache women, the positive effect of number of dependents on foraging behavior is less pronounced when fruits are in season than at other times of the year. Lastly, in the Hiwi sample we found that postreproductive women work considerably harder than women of reproductive age in the root season but not in other seasons of the year. We discuss how ecological variation in constraints, the number of health insults to children that Hiwi and Ache mothers can avoid, and the fitness benefits they can gain from spending time in food acquisition and child care might account for differences and similarities in the foraging behaviors of subgroups of Hiwi and Ache mothers across different seasons of the year. Valid tests of the explanations we propose will require considerable effort to measure the relationship between maternal food acquisition, child care, and adverse health outcomes in offspring.},

These bonds are so important that disrupting them leads to health problems, and difficulties forming or maintaining friendships attend neuropsychiatric disorders like autism and depression. Other animals also have friends, suggesting that friendship is not solely a human invention but is instead an evolved trait. A neuroethological approach applies behavioral, neurobiological, and molecular techniques to explain friendship with reference to its underlying mechanisms, development, evolutionary origins, and biological function. Recent studies implicate a shared suite of neural circuits and neuromodulatory pathways in the formation, maintenance, and manipulation of friendships across humans and other animals. Health consequences and reproductive advantages in mammals additionally suggest that friendship has adaptive benefits. We argue that understanding the neuroethology of friendship in humans and other animals brings us closer to knowing fully what it means to be human.},

	abstract = {Studies across a range of species have shown that sociability has positive fitness consequences. Among baboons, both increased infant survival and adult longevity have been associated with the maintenance of strong, equitable and durable social bonds. However, not all baboon populations show these patterns of bonding. South African chacma baboons, Papio ursinus, in the Drakensberg Mountains and De Hoop Nature Reserve show cyclical variation in social relations across time, with strong bonds formed only during certain times of the year. Using long-term data from the De Hoop baboons, we tested whether social relations influence female reproductive success in our study group in a manner similar to other baboon populations. Our results show that the number of strong bonds a female maintained predicted birth rate, and that the number of weak bonds a female possessed predicted infant 12-month survival and infant longevity. Fitness-related benefits of sociability were, however, independent of female dominance rank, and there was no relationship between the number of weak and strong bonds a female maintained. One possible explanation for the influence of weak as well as strong bonds in our study group may be that variation in demographic and ecological conditions across populations may favour the use of different social strategies by females. In our sample, weak bonds as well as strong bonds appear to be instrumental to achieving fitness-related benefits.},

	abstract = {Objective It is widely recognized that social networks and loneliness have effects on health. The present study assesses the differential association that the components of the social network and the subjective perception of loneliness have with health, and analyzes whether this association is different across different countries.   Methods A total of 10 800 adults were interviewed in Finland, Poland and Spain. Loneliness was assessed by means of the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale. Individuals’ social networks were measured by asking about the number of members in the network, how often they had contacts with these members, and whether they had a close relationship. The differential association of loneliness and the components of the social network with health was assessed by means of hierarchical linear regression models, controlling for relevant covariates.   Results In all three countries, loneliness was the variable most strongly correlated with health after controlling for depression, age, and other covariates. Loneliness contributed more strongly to health than any component of the social network. The relationship between loneliness and health was stronger in Finland ({\textbar}β{\textbar} = 0.25) than in Poland ({\textbar}β{\textbar} = 0.16) and Spain ({\textbar}β{\textbar} = 0.18). Frequency of contact was the only component of the social network that was moderately correlated with health.   Conclusions Loneliness has a stronger association with health than the components of the social network. This association is similar in three different European countries with different socio-economic and health characteristics and welfare systems. The importance of evaluating and screening feelings of loneliness in individuals with health problems should be taken into account. Further studies are needed in order to be able to confirm the associations found in the present study and infer causality.},

We performed a social network analysis in a reef shark population to assess the vulnerability of the global network to node removal under different scenarios. We found that the network was generally robust to the removal of nodes with high centrality. The network appeared also highly robust to experimental fishing. Individual shark catchability decreased as a function of experience, as revealed by comparing capture frequency and site presence. Altogether, these features suggest that individuals learnt to avoid capture, which ultimately increased network robustness to experimental catch-and-release. Our results also suggest that some caution must be taken when using capture–recapture models often used to assess population size as assumptions (such as equal probabilities of capture and recapture) may be violated by individual learning to escape recapture.},

We review the causes and consequences of decline in primate diversity in Africa and argue that the major causes of decline fall into four interrelated categories: deforestation, bushmeat harvest, disease and climate change. We go on to evaluate the rarity and distribution of species to identify those species that may be particularly vulnerable to threats and examine whether these species share any characteristic traits. Two factors are identified that suggest that our current evaluation of extinction risk may be overly optimistic; evidence suggests that the value of existing forest fragments may have been credited with greater conservation value in supporting primate populations than they actually have and it is clear that the extinction debt from historical deforestation has not being adequately considered. We use this evaluation to suggest what future actions will be advantageous to advance primate conservation in Africa and evaluate some very positive conservation gains that are currently occurring.},

Many attempts have been made to understand both the distinctiveness of primate brains and the variation observed within the order: How did such variation evolve and why, and what are its cognitive implications? Following Jerison's2 masterly review thirty years ago, comparative studies have highlighted suggestive correlations of brain size. However, the meaning and validity of these correlations have been vigorously debated. It has become clear that progress depends on taking great care in the use of comparative methods and in finding multiple converging strands of comparative evidence as opposed to making speculative interpretations of single correlations. In particular, recent work demonstrates the value of examining how evolutionary changes at different anatomical levels interrelate.},

We searched approximately 1,000 articles in four primatology journals, together with other relevant databases, for examples of innovation. The reported incidence of innovation is higher in males and adults, and lower in females and nonadults, than would be expected by chance given the estimated relative proportions of these groups. Amongst chimpanzees, the only species for which there are sufficient data to consider alone, there is a similar sex difference in the propensity to innovate, but no effect of age. Chimpanzees of low social rank are reported as innovators more frequently than high-ranking chimpanzees are. Male chimpanzees innovate more often than females in sexual, courtship, mating and display contexts; that is, in contexts likely to increase access to mates. The largest number of recorded observations are in the foraging context, wherein contrary to expectations, there is no evidence for female chimpanzees exhibiting more innovation than males. The study is the first extensive investigation of behavioral innovation in primates and provides evidence that much individual variation in the propensity to innovate can be explained in terms of sex, age, and social rank.},

	abstract = {The human lifespan has traversed a long evolutionary and historical path, from short-lived primate ancestors to contemporary Japan, Sweden, and other longevity frontrunners. Analyzing this trajectory is crucial for understanding biological and sociocultural processes that determine the span of life. Here we reveal a fundamental regularity. Two straight lines describe the joint rise of life expectancy and lifespan equality: one for primates and the second one over the full range of human experience from average lifespans as low as 2 y during mortality crises to more than 87 y for Japanese women today. Across the primate order and across human populations, the lives of females tend to be longer and less variable than the lives of males, suggesting deep evolutionary roots to the male disadvantage. Our findings cast fresh light on primate evolution and human history, opening directions for research on inequality, sociality, and aging.},

	abstract = {In a stochastic environment, long‐term fitness can be influenced by variation, covariation, and serial correlation in vital rates (survival and fertility). Yet no study of an animal population has parsed the contributions of these three aspects of variability to long‐term fitness. We do so using a unique database that includes complete life‐history information for wild‐living individuals of seven primate species that have been the subjects of long‐term (22–45 years) behavioral studies. Overall, the estimated levels of vital rate variation had only minor effects on long‐term fitness, and the effects of vital rate covariation and serial correlation were even weaker. To explore why, we compared estimated variances of adult survival in primates with values for other vertebrates in the literature and found that adult survival is significantly less variable in primates than it is in the other vertebrates. Finally, we tested the prediction that adult survival, because it more strongly influences fitness in a constant environment, will be less variable than newborn survival, and we found only mixed support for the prediction. Our results suggest that wild primates may be buffered against detrimental fitness effects of environmental stochasticity by their highly developed cognitive abilities, social networks, and broad, flexible diets.},

	abstract = {Primate tourism is a growing trend in habitat countries, but few assessments of its impact on primate groups are available. We compare infant mortality in a group of Tibetan macaques (Macaca thibetana) 6 yr before the government translocated the group and subsequently used them for tourism (1986–91), 12 yr during management for tourism (1992–2002, 2004), and 1 yr when management was temporarily suspended (2003). We also compare aggression rates among adults before and during management, and test several hypotheses about specific factors (numbers of tourists, degree of range restriction, demographic changes, changes in α-males) that may have harmed infants. Infant mortality was significantly higher during management than before, but it was similar before management vs. during its suspension. After management began, serious attacks on infants occurred shortly before they died, and many infant corpses had bite wounds. Typically, infants sustained wounds after aggression broke out among adults in the provisioning area used for tourist viewing. Adult aggression rates in the provisioning area correlated positively with infant mortality over time. Range restriction accounted for 54.5\% of the variation in infant mortality, and was more closely associated with both mortality and aggression than any other specific factor examined. We hypothesize that range restriction led to increased infant mortality by raising aggression levels in the provisioning area. We conclude that infant mortality is useful as an indicator of the impact of tourism on primate groups, and that range restriction is an inappropriate tourism management practice.},

	abstract = {Many large animal species have a high risk of extinction. This is usually thought to result simply from the way that species traits associated with vulnerability, such as low reproductive rates, scale with body size. In a broad-scale analysis of extinction risk in mammals, we find two additional patterns in the size selectivity of extinction risk. First, impacts of both intrinsic and environmental factors increase sharply above a threshold body mass around 3 kilograms. Second, whereas extinction risk in smaller species is driven by environmental factors, in larger species it is driven by a combination of environmental factors and intrinsic traits. Thus, the disadvantages of large size are greater than generally recognized, and future loss of large mammal biodiversity could be far more rapid than expected.
Large mammals weighing more than 3 kilograms are more likely than smaller species to go extinct in response to human-induced environmental changes.

* Here, we present ‘letsR’, a package for the R statistical computing environment, designed to handle and analyse macroecological data such as species’ geographic distributions (polygons in shapefile format and point occurrences) and environmental variables (in raster format). The package also includes functions to obtain data on species’ habitat use, description year and current as well as temporal trends in conservation status as provided by the IUCN RedList online data base.


*  ‘letsR’ main functionalities are based on the presence–absence matrices that can be created with the package's functions and from which other functions can be applied to generate, for example species richness rasters, geographic mid-points of species and species- and site-based attributes.


* We exemplify the package's functionality by describing and evaluating the geographic pattern of species’ description year in tailless amphibians. All data preparation and most analyses were made using the ‘letsR’ functions. Our example illustrates the package's capability for conducting macroecological analyses under a single computer platform, potentially helping researchers to save time and effort in this endeavour.},

	abstract = {The evolution of ecological idiosyncrasies in Madagascar has often been attributed to selective pressures stemming from extreme unpredictability in climate and resource availability compared to other tropical areas. With the exception of rainfall, few studies have investigated these assumptions. To assess the hypothesis that Madagascar’s paucity of frugivores is due to unreliability in fruiting resources, we use statistical modeling to analyze phenology datasets and their environmental correlates from two tropical wet forests, the Réserve Naturelle Intégrale Betampona in Madagascar, and Kibale National Park in Uganda. At each site we found that temperature is a good environmental predictor of fruit availability. We found no evidence of a significant difference in the predictability of fruit availability between the two sites, although the shorter duration of phenological monitoring at Betampona (two years, versus 15 years at Kibale) limits our ability to infer long-term patterns. Comparisons of long-term temperature data from each site (15 years from Kibale and 14 from Betampona) indicate that temperature is more predictable at Betampona than at Kibale. However, there does appear to be a difference between the two sites in the total fruit availability at any given time, with fruit being generally less abundant at Betampona. Our results appear contrary to the prevailing hypothesis of a selective force imposed by unpredictable resource availability or temperature, and we suggest other possible explanations for Madagascar’s unique biota.},

We therefore discuss the strengths and weaknesses of modelling approaches for different types of network data and for answering different questions relating to disease transmission. 4.We argue that statistical modelling frameworks designed specifically for network analysis offer great potential in directly relating network structure to infection. They have the potential to be powerful tools in analysing empirical contact data used in epidemiological studies, but remain untested for use in networks of spatio-temporal associations. 5.As a result, we argue that developments in the statistical analysis of empirical contact data are critical given the ready availability of dynamic network data from bio-logging studies. Further, we encourage improved integration of statistical network approaches into epidemiological research to facilitate the generation of novel modelling frameworks and help extend our understanding of disease transmission in natural populations.

In Madagascar, several small spatial scale studies have shown that anthropogenic habitat modification affects the density and distribution of many lemur species. Ecological niche models can be used to examine broad-scale influences of anthropogenic impacts on primate distributions. In this study, we examine how climate and anthropogenic factors influence the distribution of 11 Eulemur species using ecological niche models. Specifically, we created one set of models only using rainfall and temperature variables. We then created a second set of models that combined these climate variables with three anthropogenic factors: distance to dense settlements, villages, and croplands. We used MaxEnt to generate all the models. We found that the addition of anthropogenic variables improved the climate models. Also, most Eulemur species exhibited reduced predicted geographic distributions once anthropogenic factors were added to the model. Distance to dense settlements was the most important anthropogenic factor in most cases. We suggest that including anthropogenic variables in ecological niche models is important for understanding primate distributions, especially in regions with significant human impacts. In addition, we identify several Eulemur species that were most affected by anthropogenic factors and should be the focus of increased conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {Research with the rhesus macaque population on Cayo Santiago can provide a unique perspective on the costs of sociality and reproduction in primates. Because the Cayo macaques live in unusually large groups and in a predator-free environment, in which their artificial food source lacks seasonal variation in abundance or quality, these monkeys constitute a semi-experimental study of the costs and benefits of group living. Here we review several long- and short-term studies that have focused on female life history and stress physiology. Long-term demographic data have shown that rhesus macaque females of middle- and low-ranking matrilines have lower adult survival probabilities than females of high-ranking matrilines. Costs of reproductive effort are also evident: adult females were more likely to die during the birth than during the mating season and they experienced higher cortisol levels when lactating. Lower-ranking females, in particular, experienced greater relative increase in cortisol production during lactation, in comparison to middle- and high-ranking females. Older high-ranking females had lower plasma cortisol levels than younger ones but cortisol levels were similarly high among young and old middle- and low-ranking females. Higher plasma cortisol levels and/or fecal glucocorticoid concentrations are associated with higher plasma concentrations of some proinflammatory cytokines. High cortisol, in turn, may be associated with chronic inflammation, and perhaps also with immunosuppression. In sum, the studies reviewed here provide multiple lines of evidence that sociality and reproductive effort impose measurable costs on female rhesus macaques. In line with socioecological theory, female dominance rank consistently emerges as an important modulator of variation in female life histories and physiology. The Cayo Santiago macaques are therefore a valuable model for elucidating the mechanisms by which within-group competition and reproduction impact health and survival in nonhuman primates and in humans.

	abstract = {Both social isolation and loneliness are associated with increased mortality, but it is uncertain whether their effects are independent or whether loneliness represents the emotional pathway through which social isolation impairs health. We therefore assessed the extent to which the association between social isolation and mortality is mediated by loneliness. We assessed social isolation in terms of contact with family and friends and participation in civic organizations in 6,500 men and women aged 52 and older who took part in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing in 2004–2005. A standard questionnaire measure of loneliness was administered also. We monitored all-cause mortality up to March 2012 (mean follow-up 7.25 y) and analyzed results using Cox proportional hazards regression. We found that mortality was higher among more socially isolated and more lonely participants. However, after adjusting statistically for demographic factors and baseline health, social isolation remained significantly associated with mortality (hazard ratio 1.26, 95\% confidence interval, 1.08–1.48 for the top quintile of isolation), but loneliness did not (hazard ratio 0.92, 95\% confidence interval, 0.78–1.09). The association of social isolation with mortality was unchanged when loneliness was included in the model. Both social isolation and loneliness were associated with increased mortality. However, the effect of loneliness was not independent of demographic characteristics or health problems and did not contribute to the risk associated with social isolation. Although both isolation and loneliness impair quality of life and well-being, efforts to reduce isolation are likely to be more relevant to mortality.},

Mortality and first incidence of ischemic heart disease, cancer, stroke, and hypertension were assessed over the next 15 years. Outcome data were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, SES, and baseline health status. Persons with histories of a given morbidity at or prior to baseline were excluded from the analyses of that morbidity. Social network measures, particularly network scope (a measure of the number of different domains in which a person has social contacts), were powerful predictors of 15-year mortality hazard, but weak predictors of incident disease. Only network scope predicted IHD incidence, and none of the other morbidities was predicted by the social network measures. However, social network measures were strong predictors of both cause-specific and all-cause mortality among persons who had incident cases of IHD, cancer, and stroke. These data suggest that social networks may be more effective in supporting recovery after illness has occurred than in preventing the incidence of new disease.},

Drawing on data from four nationally representative longitudinal samples of the US population, we implemented an innovative life course design to assess the prospective association of both structural and functional dimensions of social relationships (social integration, social support, and social strain) with objectively measured biomarkers of physical health (C-reactive protein, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, and body mass index) within each life stage, including adolescence and young, middle, and late adulthood, and compare such associations across life stages. We found that a higher degree of social integration was associated with lower risk of physiological dysregulation in a dose–response manner in both early and later life. Conversely, lack of social connections was associated with vastly elevated risk in specific life stages. For example, social isolation increased the risk of inflammation by the same magnitude as physical inactivity in adolescence, and the effect of social isolation on hypertension exceeded that of clinical risk factors such as diabetes in old age. Analyses of multiple dimensions of social relationships within multiple samples across the life course produced consistent and robust associations with health. Physiological impacts of structural and functional dimensions of social relationships emerge uniquely in adolescence and midlife and persist into old age.},

The focus on this 250-year window, however, obscures some of the most profound problems associated with climate change. Here, we argue that the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, a period during which the overwhelming majority of human-caused carbon emissions are likely to occur, need to be placed into a long-term context that includes the past 20 millennia, when the last Ice Age ended and human civilization developed, and the next ten millennia, over which time the projected impacts of anthropogenic climate change will grow and persist. This long-term perspective illustrates that policy decisions made in the next few years to decades will have profound impacts on global climate, ecosystems and human societies — not just for this century, but for the next ten millennia and beyond.},

Now, in addition to identifying the causes and phylogenetic distribution of normative, species-specific behavior patterns for interspecific comparisons, there is widespread recognition of the need to incorporate intraspecific variation. This variation is evident across groups and populations of the same species as well over the long histories of single groups of long-lived, socially complex animals with overlapping generations. Yet, analyses of both cross-sectional and longitudinal data require explicit criteria about how to classify and interpret behavioral variation, and must be sensitive to the limitations of space-for-time substitutions in these comparisons. Current approaches have made great advances, but there remains an urgent challenge of understanding intraspecific variation in a way that will facilitate the development of new predictive models to assess population resilience and extinction risks in the face of climate change and other anthropogenic influences.},

However, until recently, our understanding of the possible impact of seasonality on this shift has been limited because we have little general knowledge of how seasonality affects the lives of primates. This book documents the extent of seasonality in food abundance in tropical woody vegetation, and then presents systematic analyses of the impact of seasonality in food supply on the behavioural ecology of non-human primates. Syntheses in this volume then produce broad generalizations concerning the impact of seasonality on behavioural ecology and reproduction in both human and non-human primates, and apply these insights to primate and human evolution. Written for graduate students and researchers in biological anthropology and behavioural ecology, this is an absorbing account of how seasonality may have affected an important episode in our own evolution.},

	abstract = {Those who have been privileged to watch baboons long enough to know them as individuals and who have learned to interpret some of their more subtle interactions will attest that the rapid flow of baboon behavior can at times be overwhelming. In fact, some of the most sophisticated and influential observation methods for sampling vertebrate social behavior grew out of baboon studies, invented by scientists who were trying to cope with the intricacies of baboon behavior. Barbara Smuts' eloquent study of baboons reveals a new depth to their behavior and extends the theories needed to account for it. While adhering to the most scrupulous methodological strictures, the author maintains an open research strategy--respecting her subjects by approaching them with the open mind of an ethnographer and immersing herself in the complexities of baboon social life before formulating her research design, allowing her to detect and document a new level of subtlety in their behavior. At the Gilgil site, described in this book, she could stroll and sit within a few feet of her subjects. By maintaining such proximity she was able to watch and listen to intimate exchanges within the troop; she was able, in other words, to shift the baboons well along the continuum from "subject" to "informant." By doing so she has illuminated new networks of special relationships in baboons. This empirical contribution accompanies theoretical insights that not only help to explain many of the inconsistencies of previous studies but also provide the foundation for a whole new dimension in the study of primate behavior: analysis oft he dynamics of long-term, intimate relationships and their evolutionary significance. At every stage of research human observers have underestimated the baboon. These intelligent, curious, emotional, and long-lived creatures are capable of employing stratagems and forming relationships that are not easily detected by traditional research methods. In the process of unraveling their complex social relationships, Smuts has revealed that these masters of strategy and aggressive competition are equally capable of patience, tenderness, and concern. Barbara B. Smuts is professor of psychology and anthropology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. She is also the author of Primate Societies.},

Baboon males go through the following phases with respect to the use of mating tactics, as they are longer in the group and thus grow older and, as a rule, drop in rank: Phase 1. Peripheral, relatively little social contact, low mating success, building up of a social bond with a few females. Phase 2. High mating success, based on individual fighting ability, social bonds mainly with females that are, or will soon be, sexually attractive. Phase 3, variant a. (Males that were very successful in Phase 2). Considerable time devoted to guarding infants conceived in phase 2 and to the mothers of those infants. Mating activity drops sharply compared to Phase 2. Phase 3, variant b. (Males that did not go through a very successful Phase 2). Low mating success through whatever tactic, relatively peripheral. Phase 4. Relatively high mating success, partly through collaboration with other males. Considerable time is invested in the care for potential offspring and their mothers. Phase 5. Diminishing share in the total mating activity in the group. The support for infants is spread over a relatively large class of infants conceived after immigration. Social contact with a large number of females. The data did not show the relation between agonistic rank and mating success predicted by ALTMANN'S priority-of-access model. A modification of the model is presented, which allows for coalition formation among males that are too low in rank to be successful on their own. This model could not fully explain, however, the exceptional success of some middle ranking males. The theory of Coalition games can give insight in the processes that lead to distributions of mating success that depart from the modified priority-of-acces model. The lack of agreement between the data and the original priority-of-access model cannot be explained by higher selectivity of the high ranking males. The only qualitative parameter of consorts obtained, according to which high ranking males had an advantage, is the time of the day on which mating activity takes place. This is a direct result of the way in which males obtain their consorts. Consorts are often formed in the sleeping trees during the night or in the early morning. In that situation single, strong males have an advantage in conflicts against coalitions of lower ranking males. Lower ranking males have a relative advantage later in the day, when conflicts are fought out on the ground.},

	abstract = {One key question in social evolution is the identification of factors that promote the formation and maintenance of stable bonds between females and males beyond the mating context. Baboons lend themselves to examine this question, as they vary in social organisation and male-female association patterns. We report the results from the first systematic observations of individually identified wild female Guinea baboons. Guinea baboons live in a multilevel society with female-biased dispersal. Although several males could be found within 5 m of females, each female chiefly associated with one “primary” male at the 2 m distance. Social interactions occurred predominantly with the primary male, and female reproductive state had little influence on interaction patterns. The number of females per primary male varied from 1 to 4. During the 17-month study period, half of the females transferred between different males one or multiple times. A subset of females maintained weaker affiliative nonsexual relationships with other “secondary” males. Units composed of primary males with females, and occasional secondary males, apparently form the core of the Guinea baboon society. The social organisation and mating patterns of Guinea and hamadryas baboons may have a common evolutionary origin, despite notable differences in relationship quality. Specifically, Guinea baboon females appear to have greater leverage in their association patterns than hamadryas baboon females. Although we cannot yet explain the lack of overt male control over females, results generally support the notion that phylogenetic descent may play an important role in shaping social systems.},

	abstract = {Previous comparative studies have suggested that the distribution of arginine vasopressin (AVP) pathways within the brain is associated with species-typical patterns of social behavior. In the current study, male parental behavior and aggression were compared in two species of Peromyscus. As predicted based on other studies, male mice from a monogamous species, the California mouse Peromyscus californicus, spent more time providing parental care to offspring than males from a polygamous species, the white-footed mouse Peromyscus leucopus. Sexually naive male California mice also attacked opponents more rapidly than white-footed mice during resident–intruder and neutral aggression tests. Since AVP has been shown to modulate these behaviors, we compared the distribution of vasopressinergic neurons and receptors. We predicted that greater AVP-immunoreactive (AVP-ir) staining in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and AVP receptor density in the lateral septum would occur in the species with low levels of paternal care because this pattern was found in similar comparisons with sexually naive monogamous and polygamous voles. In contrast, in our study, monogamous male mice showed more AVP-ir staining in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis than the polygamous species, as well as more AVP receptors in the lateral septum. Parental behavior therefore does not appear to predict differences in patterns of AVP-ir staining and receptor distribution across species or vice versa. We propose the hypothesis that aggression may be better correlated with species patterns of AVP-ir staining density and receptor distribution.},

Because there is little a priori support for alternative explanations, we hypothesized that permanent male-female association in primates serves to reduce the risk of infanticide by strange males whenever females and infants are closely associated. For a phylogenetic test of this hypothesis, we reconstructed the evolution of male-female and female-infant association among primates. The results of Maddison's concentrated changes test confirmed the prediction that mother-infant association, as opposed to infant parking, and female-male association did not evolve independently. Changes in litter size and activity, in contrast, were not significantly associated with evolutionary changes in male-female association. Thus, we demonstrate a fundamental link between primate life history and social behaviour, explain the most basic type of variation in primate social organization, and propose an additional determinant of social organization that may also operate in other mammals.},

	abstract = {Infanticide was observed for the first time in a wild, non-provisioned troop of Japanese macaques on Yakushima Island, Japan. Eight adult resident males attacked unweaned infants in the pre- and early mating season, and one infanticide was observed directly. These attacks were not consistent with the social pathology, side effect of male aggression, cannibalism, or the resource defense hypothesis, but were generally consistent with the sexual-selection hypothesis. First, most male attackers had risen in dominance rank because several high-ranking males had left the troop. Second, in 78\% of cases, male attackers had not previously been observed to mate with the mothers of victims. Moreover, analysis of subject animal DNA showed that males did not attack their own offspring. The two mothers who lost their unweaned infants, however, were not subsequently observed to mate. In fact, almost no mating behavior was observed in the troop. This was most likely due to a poor fruiting year. Resumption of mating by females who lost their infants may have been inhibited by an intervening environmental variable which suppressed female reproductive function. These observations contribute to a growing body of evidence which suggests that sexually selected infanticide can occur in seasonally breeding, multi-male, multi-female primate groups. Female Japanese macaques are known to mate with multiple males. We found evidence that female mating with multiple males inhibits contact aggression towards their infants. Adult males attacked infants eight times more often when they had not previously mated with the mother.},

	abstract = {Although common in birds, social monogamy, or pair-living, is rare among mammals because internal gestation and lactation in mammals makes it advantageous for males to seek additional mating opportunities. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of social monogamy among mammals: as a male mate-guarding strategy, because of the benefits of biparental care, or as a defense against infanticidal males. However, comparative analyses have been unable to resolve the root causes of monogamy. Primates are unusual among mammals because monogamy has evolved independently in all of the major clades. Here we combine trait data across 230 primate species with a Bayesian likelihood framework to test for correlated evolution between monogamy and a range of traits to evaluate the competing hypotheses. We find evidence of correlated evolution between social monogamy and both female ranging patterns and biparental care, but the most compelling explanation for the appearance of monogamy is male infanticide. It is only the presence of infanticide that reliably increases the probability of a shift to social monogamy, whereas monogamy allows the secondary adoption of paternal care and is associated with a shift to discrete ranges. The origin of social monogamy in primates is best explained by long lactation periods caused by artriciality, making primate infants particularly vulnerable to infanticidal males. We show that biparental care shortens relative lactation length, thereby reducing infanticide risk and increasing reproductive rates. These phylogenetic analyses support a key role for infanticide in the social evolution of primates, and potentially, humans.},

	abstract = {Male mammals often kill conspecific offspring. The benefits of such infanticide to males, and its costs to females, probably vary across mammalian social and mating systems. We used comparative analyses to show that infanticide primarily evolves in social mammals in which reproduction is monopolized by a minority of males. It has not promoted social counterstrategies such as female gregariousness, pair living, or changes in group size and sex ratio, but is successfully prevented by female sexual promiscuity, a paternity dilution strategy. These findings indicate that infanticide is a consequence, rather than a cause, of contrasts in mammalian social systems affecting the intensity of sexual conflict.
Why some male animals kill infants
One of the most unpleasant aspects of social life in some animal species is killing of the young by adult males. Lukas and Huchard looked at mammalian groups with a variety of social systems—from mice to mongoose and from bats to bears. Infanticidal behavior in males appeared to be a result of sexual conflict in social species with nonseasonal breeding. Killing of a female's young by a new male will speed her return to a reproductive state and allow him to raise his own young. Evolutionarily, the only successful defense in females appears to be polyandry: Females that mate with multiple males make it hard for any one male to know that he is, or is not, the father of her offspring.

Field data from 260 mammalian species suggest that males killing young is an evolutionary consequence of sexual conflict.

Unusual for mammals, humans are notably socially monogamous, with pair bonding sometimes lasting decades. Why? Lukas and Clutton-Brock (p. 526; see the Perspective by Kappeler) examined data from over 2500 mammalian species across 26 orders containing 60 evolutionary transitions to monogamy. In every case, the ancestral condition was one where females were solitary and where male infanticide was unusual. Monogamy appears to arise not as a response to a need for paternal care, but largely as a mate-guarding strategy.
The evolution of social monogamy has intrigued biologists for over a century. Here, we show that the ancestral condition for all mammalian groups is of solitary individuals and that social monogamy is derived almost exclusively from this social system. The evolution of social monogamy does not appear to have been associated with a high risk of male infanticide, and paternal care is a consequence rather than a cause of social monogamy. Social monogamy has evolved in nonhuman mammals where breeding females are intolerant of each other and female density is low, suggesting that it represents a mating strategy that has developed where males are unable to defend access to multiple females.
Social monogamy developed in mammalian species where males could not defend access to multiple females. [Also see Perspective by Kappeler]

	abstract = {Sex-biased dispersal can reduce kin cooperation and kin competition in the dispersed sex. However, this may not be the case when group-living animals engage in parallel dispersal, which occurs when an individual transfers between groups together with other animals or immigrates alone into a group that contains familiar animals. Despite this potential effect on kin cooperation and competition, few studies have thoroughly investigated how parallel dispersal affects the kin composition of groups. To further our understanding of this topic, we investigated the effect of parallel dispersal on access to coresident kin in male white-faced capuchins, Cebus capucinus. Between 2006 and 2013, we collected demographic and genetic data from two to five groups in Sector Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. We genotyped 41 females and 39 males at 14 short tandem repeat loci, and we calculated their estimated relatedness values. The majority of males dispersed in parallel, and parallel dispersing males were more closely related to one another than were other males. Parallel immigrant males and natal females resided with a similar number of same-sex kin. Single immigrant males in multimale groups rarely resided with male kin, and they resided with fewer same-sex kin than did parallel immigrant males and natal females. Because parallel dispersal offers an opportunity for males to form long-lasting cooperative relationships with familiar kin, this dispersal pattern should be taken into account in future models of the evolution of social structure.},

Values of all 3 metabolites [3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), the norepinephrine metabolite; 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), the serotonin metabolite; and homovanillic acid (HVA), the dopamine metabolite] declined consistently with dentally-calibrated maturation, and few taxon-related differences were apparent among juveniles. Adult females were too few for adequate comparison, but a discriminant function suggested that they might differ by taxon. Adult males of the 2 species differed strikingly from juveniles and from each other. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, adult male anubis had significantly lower HVA and MHPG, and higher 5-HIAA levels, than predicted from the overall, age-related trend, and MHPG continued to decline with age among adults. As young adults, male hamadryas had low 5-HIAA and a high HVA/5-HIAA ratio, while older males [normatively one-male unit (OMU) leaders] showed a reversal in the trend, with 5-HIAA rising and the HVA/5-HIAA ratio tending to fall. We speculate that the results are related to the dispersing and philopatric ontogenies of anubis and hamadryas males, respectively. Adult male anubis, whose fitness depends on building social networks with nonkin, have high relative serotonin activity, commonly associated with greater social circumspection and skill. Young adult male hamadryas, living among agnatic kin and mating opportunistically, exhibit low 5-HIAA levels, generally associated with impulsivity and social irresponsibility. This reverses as a male approaches the age at which he is normatively the leader of a one-male unit (OMU), and his fitness depends on his maintaining stable relationships with other leaders and with females.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the variation in behaviour-related genes within and between populations provides insight into how evolutionary processes shape consistent behavioural traits (i.e. personality). Deliberate introductions of non-native species offer opportunities to investigate how such genes differ between native and introduced populations and how polymorphisms in the genes are related to variation in behaviour. Here, we compared the genetic variation of the two ‘personality’ genes, DRD4 and SERT, between a native (United Kindom, UK) and an introduced (New Zealand, NZ) population of dunnocks, Prunella modularis. The NZ population showed a significantly lower number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared to the UK population. Standardized F’st estimates of the personality genes and neutral microsatellites indicate that selection (anthropogenic and natural) likely occurred during and post the introduction event. Notably, the largest genetic differentiation was found in the intronic regions of the genes. In the NZ population, we also examined the association between polymorphisms in DRD4 and SERT and two highly repeatable behavioural traits: flight-initiation distance and mating status (promiscuous females and co-breeding males). We found 38 significant associations (for different allele effect models) between the two behavioural traits and the studied genes. Further, 22 of the tested associations showed antagonistic allele effects for males and females. Our findings illustrate how introduction events and accompanying ecological changes could influence the genetic diversity of behaviour-related genes. This article is protected by copyright.

	abstract = {* Sociality has been shown to have adaptive value for gregarious species, with more socially integrated animals within groups experiencing higher reproductive success and longevity. The value of social integration is often suggested to derive from an improved ability to deal with social stress within a group; other potential stressors have received less attention.


* We investigated the relationship between environmental temperature, an important non-social stressor, and social integration in wild female vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus), using implanted data loggers to obtain direct measures of core body temperature.


* Heterothermy (as measured by 24-h amplitude of body temperature) increased, and 24-h minima of body temperature decreased, as the 24-h minimum ambient temperature decreased. As winter progressed, monkeys became increasingly heterothermic and displayed lower 24-h minima of body temperature.


* Monkeys with a greater number of social partners displayed a smaller 24-h amplitude (that is, were more homoeothermic) and higher 24-h minima of body temperature (that is, became less hypothermic), than did animals with fewer social partners.


* Our findings demonstrate that social integration has a direct influence on thermoregulatory ability: individual animals that form and maintain more social relationships within their group experience improved thermal competence compared to those with fewer social relationships.


* Given the likely energetic consequences of thermal benefits, our findings offer a viable physiological explanation that can help account for variations in fitness in relation to individual differences in social integration.},

	abstract = {This paper describes male-female dyadic social relationships in C. capucinus, detailing the types of costs and benefits exchanged between the sexes. A single group of wild white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus) was studied in Lomas Barbudal Biological Reserve, Costa Rica, for 24 months. A total of 953 hours of focal animal data were collected on 4 adult males and 6 adult females. The patterning of social interactions was studied in an attempt to assess the outcome of disputes between males and females. In dyadic interactions, females avoided and cowered to males roughly 50 times more often than males avoided or cowered to females. Females responded fearfully to 12\% of males' neutral approaches, whereas males never responded fearfully to females' neutral approaches. Males supplanted females 15 times more often than females supplanted males. The alpha male spent more time with females than did lower-ranking males. In general, males were more responsible for proximity maintenance within male-female dyads than were the females. Females behaved aggressively to males slightly more often than vice versa, but males inflicted more severe aggression on females. The types of benefits that each sex conferred on the other were largely different. Females groomed males, but males virtually never reciprocated. Both males and females aided one another in coalitions, which were primarily directed against adult male capuchins and non-monkeys. During one portion of the study, comparison among heterosexual dyads revealed associations between male coalitionary support and both (a) female coalitionary support and (b) female grooming, suggesting interchanges of benefits. Females were able to compensate, in part, for their subordinate status relative to males, by frequently forming coalitions with other females against males. Males did not form coalitions with other adult males against females. Female-female coalitions were effective for achieving immediate goals, such as evicting males from feeding trees. However, even determined coalitions of females were ineffective in their attempts to control male group membership, without receiving aid from adult males.},

As with humans, social behaviours in other animals often occur within a broad interconnected network of social ties. Yet studies of animal social behaviour tend to focus on associations between pairs of individuals. With the increase in popularity of social network analysis, researchers have started to look beyond the dyad to examine the role of indirect connections in animal societies. Here, I provide an overview of the new knowledge that has been uncovered by these studies. I focus on research that has addressed both the causes of social behaviours, i.e. the cognitive and genetic basis of indirect connections, as well as their consequences, i.e. the impact of indirect connections on social cohesion, information transfer, cultural practices and fitness. From these studies, it is apparent that indirect connections play an important role in animal behaviour, although future research is needed to clarify their contribution.},

	abstract = {To find a dominance order most consistent with a linear hierarchy, the I\&amp;SI method minimizes two criteria: first the number of inconsistencies I (i.e. number of dyads in which the lower-ranked individual dominates the higher-ranked one) and then (without increasing I) the total strength of inconsistencies SI (i.e. the sum of rank differences between individuals of inconsistent dyads or, in other words, the sum of distances of inconsistencies from the matrix diagonal). The original algorithm developed by de Vries (1998) to achieve this goal has two drawbacks. (1) It completely relies on the ‘generalized swapping rule’ (combined with partly random reordering) to decrease I, but moving single individuals' positions instead of pairwise switching them can complement the generalized swapping rule to make a more efficient algorithm. (2) It does not consider alternative orders, if more than one exists, with equally minimized I and SI values. In this paper, an improved algorithm for the I\&amp;SI method is presented. It includes: (1) more efficient searching for optimal orders; (2) consideration of all orders with equally minimized I and SI values; and (3) choice of one or more optimal orders based on correlation with a hierarchical combination of two dominance indices: primary ranking by the proportion of dominated individuals and secondary ranking by the difference between the number of dominated individuals and the number of individuals to which the focal individual is subordinate. Microsoft Excel workbooks are provided that perform the linearity test published by de Vries (1995) and the improved algorithm.},

	abstract = {Most tropical woody plants produce new leaves and flowers in bursts rather than continuously, and most tropical forest communities display seasonal variation in the presence of new leaves, flowers, and fruits. This patterning suggests that phenological changes represent adaptations to either biotic or abiotic factors. Biotic factors may select for either a staggering or a clustering of the phenological activity of individual plant species. We review the evidence for several hypotheses. The idea that plant species can reduce predation by synchronizing their phenological activity has the best support. However, because biotic factors are often arbitrary with respect to the timing of these peaks, it is essential also to consider abiotic influences. A review of published studies demonstrates a major role for climate. Peaks in irradiance are accompanied by peaks in flushing and flowering except where water stress makes this impossible. Thus, in seasonally dry forests, many plants concentrate leafing and flowering around the start of the rainy season; they also tend to fruit at the same time, probably to minimize seedling mortality during the subsequent dry season. Phenological variation at the level of the forest community affects primary consumers who respond by dietary switching, seasonal breeding, changes in range use, or migration. During periods of scarcity, certain plant products, keystone resources, act as mainstays of the primary consumer community.},

	abstract = {Aggression is an evolutionary conserved behavior present in most species including humans. Inadequate aggression can lead to long-term detrimental personal and societal effects. Here, we differentiate between proactive and reactive forms of aggression and review the genetic determinants of it. Heritability estimates of aggression in general vary between studies due to differing assessment instruments for aggressive behavior (AB) as well as age and gender of study participants. In addition, especially non-shared environmental factors shape AB. Current hypotheses suggest that environmental effects such as early life stress or chronic psychosocial risk factors (e.g., maltreatment) and variation in genes related to neuroendocrine, dopaminergic as well as serotonergic systems increase the risk to develop AB. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the genetics of human aggression based on twin studies, genetic association studies, animal models, and epigenetic analyses with the aim to differentiate between mechanisms associated with proactive or reactive aggression. We hypothesize that from a genetic perspective, the aminergic systems are likely to regulate both reactive and proactive aggression, whereas the endocrine pathways seem to be more involved in regulation of reactive aggression through modulation of impulsivity. Epigenetic studies on aggression have associated non-genetic risk factors with modifications of the stress response and the immune system. Finally, we point to the urgent need for further genome-wide analyses and the integration of genetic and epigenetic information to understand individual differences in reactive and proactive AB. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Dominant females in social species have been hypothesized to reduce the reproductive success of their subordinates by inducing elevated circulating glucocorticoid (GC) concentrations. However, this ‘stress-related suppression' hypothesis has received little support in cooperatively breeding species, despite evident reproductive skews among females. We tested this hypothesis in the banded mongoose (Mungos mungo), a cooperative mammal in which multiple females conceive and carry to term in each communal breeding attempt. As predicted, lower ranked females had lower reproductive success, even among females that carried to term. While there were no rank-related differences in faecal glucocorticoid (fGC) concentrations prior to gestation or in the first trimester, lower ranked females had significantly higher fGC concentrations than higher ranked females in the second and third trimesters. Finally, females with higher fGC concentrations during the third trimester lost a greater proportion of their gestated young prior to their emergence from the burrow. Together, our results are consistent with a role for rank-related maternal stress in generating reproductive skew among females in this cooperative breeder. While studies of reproductive skew frequently consider the possibility that rank-related stress reduces the conception rates of subordinates, our findings highlight the possibility of detrimental effects on reproductive outcomes even after pregnancies have become established.},

	abstract = {Close distance vocalizations are an integral part of primate vocal communication. They exhibit large acoustic variation which has been suggested to constitute flexible responses to the highly variable social setting of group living animals. However, a recent study suggested that acoustic variation in close distance calls of baboons may also arise from acoustic adaptations to environmental factors in order to counteract sound degradation. We tested whether the variation in calling rate and acoustic structure of gorilla close distance vocalizations may serve to counteract distorting effects of vegetation during sound propagation. Using focal animal sampling we recorded the vocal behavior of 15 adult individuals living in two groups: one group of western lowland gorillas Gorilla gorilla gorilla and one group of mountain gorillas Gorilla beringei beringei. We considered the distance between the caller and its nearest neighbor as the minimum transmission distance of calls; while vegetation density was quantified through measures of visibility. Our analysis revealed vocal plasticity in gorilla close calls in relation to changes in visibility and nearest neighbor distance. However, the observed changes in fundamental frequency and calling rate are unlikely to counteract degrading effects of vegetation, but rather seem to reflect reactions to variation in spatial and visual separation from other group members, similar to the audience effects demonstrated in a range of other species. We propose that vocal plasticity to counteract distorting environmental effects may not be prevalent across taxa and perhaps confined to species living in heterogeneous habitats with highly variable transmission conditions.

	abstract = {Life on Earth is conspicuously more diverse in the tropics. Although this intriguing geographical pattern has been linked to many biotic and abiotic factors, their relative importance and potential interactions are still poorly understood. The way in which latitudinal changes in ecological conditions influence evolutionary processes is particularly controversial, as there is evidence for both a positive and a negative latitudinal gradient in speciation rates. Here, we identify and address some methodological issues (how patterns are analysed and how latitude is quantified) that could lead to such conflicting results. To address these issues, we assemble a comprehensive data set of the environmental correlates of latitude (including climate, net primary productivity and habitat heterogeneity) and combine it with biological, historical and molecular data to explore global patterns in recent divergence events (subspeciation). Surprisingly, we find that the harsher conditions that typify temperate habitats (lower primary productivity, decreased rainfall and more variable and unpredictable temperatures) are positively correlated with greater subspecies richness in terrestrial mammals and birds. Thus, our findings indicate that intraspecific divergence is greater in regions with lower biodiversity, a pattern that is robust to both sampling variation and latitudinal biases in taxonomic knowledge. We discuss possible causal mechanisms for the link between environmental harshness and subspecies richness (faster rates of evolution, greater likelihood of range discontinuities and more opportunities for divergence) and conclude that this pattern supports recent indications that latitudinal gradients of diversity are maintained by simultaneously higher potentials for both speciation and extinction in temperate than tropical regions.},

	abstract = {Ich habe in diesem Aufsatz kurz anzudeuten versucht, was meiner Ansicht nach das Wesentliche in Fragestellung und Methode der Ethologie ist und weshalb wir in Konrad Lorenz den Begründer moderner Ethologie erblicken. Hierbei habe ich vielleicht das Arbeitsgebiet der Ethologie weiter gefaßt, als unter Ethologen gebräuchlich ist. Wenn man aber die vielartige Arbeit jener Forscher übersieht, die sich Ethologen nennen, ist man zu dieser weiten Fassung geradezu gezwungen. Ich habe in meiner Darstellung weder Vollständigkeit noch Gleichgewicht angestrebt und, um zur Fortführung des Gesprächs anzuregen, ruhig meine Steckenpferde geritten, vor allem das Verhältnis zwischen Ethologie und Physiologie, die Gefahr der Vernachlässigung der Frage der Arterhaltung, Fragen der Methodik der ontogenetischen Forschung, und Aufgaben und Methoden der Evolutionsforschung. Bei der Einschätzung des Anteils, den Lorenz an der Entwicklung der Ethologie genommen hat und noch nimmt, habe ich als seinen Hauptbeitrag den bezeichnet, daß er uns gezeigt hat, wie man bewährtes “biologisches Denken” folgerichtig auf Verhalten anwenden kann. Daß er dabei an die Arbeit seiner Vorgänger angeknüpft hat, ist nicht mehr verwunderlich, als daß jeder Vater selbst einen Vater hat. Insbesondere scheint mir das Wesentliche an Lorenz‘ Arbeit zu sein, daß er klar gesehen hat, daß Verhaltensweisen Teile von “Organen”, von Systemen der Arterhaltung sind; daß ihre Verursachung genau so exakt untersucht werden kann wie die gleich welcher anderer Lebensvorgänge, daß ihr arterhaltender Wert ebenso systematisch und exakt aufweisbar ist wie ihre Verursachung, daß Verhaltensontogenie in grundsätzlich gleicher Weise erforscht werden kann wie die Ontogenie der Form und daß die Erforschung der Verhaltensevolution der Untersuchung der Strukturevolution parallel geht. Und obwohl Lorenz ein riesiges Tatsachenmaterial gesammelt hat, ist die Ethologie doch noch mehr durch seine Fragestellung und durch kühne Hypothesen gefördert als durch eigene Nachprüfung dieser Hypothesen. Ohne den Wert solcher Nachprüfung zu unterschätzen — ohne die es natürlich keine Weiterentwicklung gäbe — möchte ich doch behaupten, daß die durch Nachprüfung notwendig gewordenen Modifikationen neben der Leistung des ursprünglichen Ansatzes vergleichsweise unbedeutend sind. Nebenbei sei auch daran erinnert, daß eine der vielen heilsamen Nachwirkungen der Lorenzschen Arbeit das wachsende Interesse ist, das die Humanpsychologie der Ethologie entgegenbringt - ein erster Ansatz einer Entwicklung, deren Tragweite wir noch kaum übersehen können. Am Schluß noch eine Bemerkung zur Terminologie. Ich habe hier das Wort “Ethologie” auf einen Riesenkomplex von Wissenschaften angewandt, von denen manche, wie Psychologie und Physiologie, schon längst anerkannte Namen tragen. Das heißt natürlich nicht, daß ich den Namen Ethologie für dieses ganze Gebiet vorschlagen will; das wäre geschichtlich einfach falsch, weil das Wort historisch nur die Arbeit einer kleinen Gruppe von Zoologen kennzeichnet. Der Name ist natürlich gleichgültig; worauf es mir vor allem ankommt, ist darzutun, daß wir das Zusammenwachsen vieler Einzeldisziplinen zu einer vielumfassenden Wissenschaft erleben, für die es nur einen richtigen Namen gibt: “Verhaltensbiologie”. Selbstverständlich ist diese synthetische Entwicklung nicht die Arbeit eines Mannes oder gar die der Ethologen. Sie ist die Folge einer allgemeinen Neigung, Brücken zwischen verwandten Wissenschaften zu schlagen, einer Neigung, die sich in vielen Disziplinen entwickelt hat. Unter den Zoologen ist es Lorenz, der hierzu am meisten beigetragen und zudem manche Nachbardisziplinen stärker beeinflußt hat als irgendein anderer. Ich bin sogar davon überzeugt, daß diese Einwirkungen auf Nachbarwissenschaften noch lange anhalten werden und daß die Verhaltensbiologie erst am Anfang ihrer Ontogenie steht.},

It has been suggested that the local-resource-competition hypothesis will predominate when resources are scarce, and the Trivers-Willard hypothesis when resources are abundant. The relationship between maternal dominance and secondary sex ratio for 214 offspring of 61 females was examined using four troops of wild yellow baboons living in Mikumi National Park, where the population was increasing in a resource-rich habitat. For all troops combined, no significant relationship was found between offspring sex ratio and maternal rank. The four troops separately showed inconsistent trends, and in no case did the relationship reach conventional levels of statistical significance. In contrast, the local resource-competition hypothesis was supported by a study of yellow baboons done with one troop and 80 offspring in Amboseli National Park, where a massive population decline had occurred. The contrasting Amboseli and Mikumi results may be due to differences in resource-competition at the two study sites, or to stochastic variation. © 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {The relationship between longevity and lifetime reproductive success (LRS) was studied in free-ranging female baboons of Mikumi National Park, Tanzania. A severe population decline occurred between the 12th and 20th years of the study. The total sample consisted of 72 females born and reaching adulthood before the start of the population decline. There were 27 females who were adult at the start of the study and 45 who became adult within the 12 years prior to the decline. The subjects were studied until all 72 were dead and all of their offspring were either dead or at least six years old; this took 24 years. The relationship of longevity to LRS was statistically significant for the total sample and for both sub-samples, with 70\% of the total variance in LRS accounted for by longevity. Longevity was linked to LRS via a chain of statistically significant relationships: The longer the life span, the longer the reproductive life; the longer the reproductive life, the more offspring produced; the more offspring produced, the higher the LRS. Mean LRS, life span, and reproductive longevity all differed between the two sub-samples. Since the sub-samples were time-linked to a population decline affecting longevity, either sub-sample separately would fail to reflect the broader picture. This illustrates the importance of appreciable sample sizes from long-term studies in helping understand the dynamics between life history estimates and ecological conditions in variable environments.

	abstract = {Sociality confers many benefits to gregarious animals, but group-living does not come without associated costs. Social living can cause anxiety, which if prolonged can lead to stress. We investigate correlates of anxiety and stress among wild adult male olive baboons (Papio hamadryas anubis) in Gashaka-Gumti National Park, Nigeria, and present the first examination of these correlates for male baboons living in forested environments. We used rates of self-directed behaviours (SDB) to quantify anxiety, and faecal glucocorticoid (FGC) concentrations to quantify physiological stress. We first examined the relationship between SDB rates and FGC concentrations, and then examined each measure in relation to a range of variables previously linked to anxiety or stress. We found that SDB rates and FGC concentrations were not correlated with each other, nor were they related to any measure of grooming or receiving aggression. SDB rates were negatively correlated with time spent with an adult female as nearest neighbour, but were unrelated to time with another adult male as closest conspecific. FGC concentrations were unrelated to time with adult nearest neighbours of either sex. Our results add to the growing body of literature examining the psychological and physiological costs of social living among wild primates.},

	abstract = {Social network analysis provides a useful lens through which to view the structure of animal societies, and as a result its use is increasingly widespread. One challenge that many studies of animal social networks face is dealing with limited sample sizes, which introduces the potential for a high level of uncertainty in estimating the rates of association or interaction between individuals. We present a method based on Bayesian inference to incorporate uncertainty into network analyses. We test the reliability of this method at capturing both local and global properties of simulated networks, and compare it to a recently suggested method based on bootstrapping. Our results suggest that Bayesian inference can provide useful information about the underlying certainty in an observed network. When networks are well sampled, observed networks approach the real underlying social structure. However, when sampling is sparse, Bayesian inferred networks can provide realistic uncertainty estimates around edge weights. We also suggest a potential method for estimating the reliability of an observed network given the amount of sampling performed. This paper highlights how relatively simple procedures can be used to estimate uncertainty and reliability in studies using animal social network analysis.},

	abstract = {The development of non-invasive methods, particularly fecal determination, has made possible the assessment of hormone concentrations in wild animal populations. However, measuring fecal metabolites needs careful validation for each species and for each sex. We investigated whether radioimmunoassays (RIAs) previously used to measure fecal testosterone (fT) in male baboons and fecal estrogens (fE) in female baboons were well suited to measure these hormones in the opposite sex. We compared fE and fT concentrations determined by RIA to those measured by liquid chromatography combined with triple quadropole mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), a highly specific method. Additionally, we conducted a biological validation to assure that the measurements of fecal concentrations reflected physiological levels of the hormone of interest. Several tests produced expected results that led us to conclude that our RIAs can reliably measure fT and fE in both sexes, and that within-sex comparisons of these measures are valid: (i) fTRIA were significantly correlated to fTLC/MS/MS for both sexes; (ii) fTRIA were higher in adult than in immature males; (iii) fTRIA were higher in pregnant than non-pregnant females; (iv) fERIA were correlated with 17β-estradiol (fE2) and with estrone (fE1) determined by LC/MS/MS in pregnant females; (v) fERIA were significantly correlated with fE2 in non-pregnant females and nearly significantly correlated in males; (vi) fERIA were higher in adult males than in immature males. fERIA were higher in females than in males, as predicted, but unexpectedly, fTRIA were higher in females than in males, suggesting a difference in steroid metabolism in the two sexes; consequently, we conclude that while within-sex comparisons are valid, fTRIA should not be used for intersexual comparisons. Our results should open the field to important additional studies, as to date the roles of testosterone in females and estrogens in males have been little investigated.},

Here, we extend this previous analysis to a larger data set with several additional potential stressors, including actual infanticide and instability in the female dominance hierarchy. A general linear mixed model showed that reproductive state, male immigration, infanticide, female rank instability and predation all had significant effects on GC levels. Lactating females' GC levels increased in response to the arrival of immigrant males and increased even further when infanticide occurred. In contrast, cycling and pregnant females' GC levels did not change. Females also showed elevated GCs in response to instability within their own dominance hierarchy, especially if their own ranks were at risk. Females' stress responses were frequent, but specific to events that threatened their own lives, the lives of their offspring, or their dominance ranks.},

	abstract = {Adult male elephants periodically show the phenomenon of musth, a condition associated with increased aggressiveness, restlessness, significant weight reduction and markedly elevated androgen levels. It has been suggested that musth-related behaviours are costly and that therefore musth may represent a form of physiological stress. In order to provide data on this largely unanswered question, the first aim of this study was to evaluate different assays for non-invasive assessment of adrenocortical function in the male African elephant by (i) characterizing the metabolism and excretion of [3H]cortisol (3H-C) and [14C]testosterone (14C-T) and (ii) using this information to evaluate the specificity of four antibodies for determination of excreted cortisol metabolites, particularly with respect to possible cross-reactions with androgen metabolites, and to assess their biological validity using an ACTH challenge test. Based on the methodology established, the second objective was to provide data on fecal cortisol metabolite concentrations in bulls during the musth and non-musth condition. 3H-C (1 mCi) and 14C-T (100 μCi) were injected simultaneously into a 16 year old male and all urine and feces collected for 30 and 86 h, respectively. The majority (82\%) of cortisol metabolites was excreted into the urine, whereas testosterone metabolites were mainly (57\%) excreted into the feces. Almost all radioactive metabolites recovered from urine were conjugated (86\% 3H-C and 97\% 14C-T). In contrast, 86\% and \&gt;99\% of the 3H-C and 14C-T metabolites recovered from feces consisted of unconjugated forms. HPLC separations indicated the presence of various metabolites of cortisol in both urine and feces, with cortisol being abundant in hydrolysed urine, but virtually absent in feces. Although all antibodies measured substantial amounts of immunoreactivity after HPLC separation of peak radioactive samples and detected an increase in glucocorticoid output following the ACTH challenge, only two (in feces against 3α,11-oxo-cortisol metabolites, measured by an 11-oxo-etiocholanolone-EIA and in urine against cortisol, measured by a cortisol-EIA) did not show substantial cross-reactivity with excreted 14C-T metabolites and could provide an acceptable degree of specificity for reliable assessment of glucocorticoid output from urine and feces. Based on these findings, concentrations of immunoreactive 3α,11-oxo-cortisol metabolites were determined in weekly fecal samples collected from four adult bulls over periods of 11–20 months to examine whether musth is associated with increased adrenal activity. Results showed that in each male levels of these cortisol metabolites were not elevated during periods of musth, suggesting that in the African elephant musth is generally not associated with marked elevations in glucocorticoid output. Given the complex nature of musth and the variety of factors that are likely to influence its manifestation, it is clear, however, that further studies, particularly on free-ranging animals, are needed before a possible relationship between musth and adrenal function can be resolved. This study also clearly illustrates the potential problems associated with cross-reacting metabolites of gonadal steroids in EIAs measuring glucocorticoid metabolites. This has to be taken into account when selecting assays and interpreting results of glucocorticoid metabolite analysis, not only for studies in the elephant but also in other species.},

	abstract = {Summary
Discriminating among individuals is a critical social behavior in humans and many other animals [1–3] and is often required for offspring and mate recognition, territorial or coalitional behaviors, signaler reliability assessment, and social hierarchies [4–9]. Being individually discriminated is more difficult in larger groups, and large group size may select for increased individuality–signature information–in social signals, to facilitate discrimination [4, 10–14]. Small-scale studies suggest that more social species have greater individuality in their social signals, such as contact calls [4, 12, 13]. However, this relationship has not been evaluated in a broader-scale evolutionary context or in social signals other than contact calls. It is not yet known whether social group size may be viewed as a general evolutionary driver of individuality. Here we show a strong positive evolutionary link between social group size in sciurid rodents and individuality in their social alarm calls. Social group size explained over 88\% of the variation in vocal individuality in phylogenetic independent contrasts. Species living in larger groups, but not in more complex groups, had more signature information in their calls. Our results suggest that social group size may promote the evolution of individual signatures and that the sociality-individuality relationship may be a general phenomenon in nature.},

Although social dynamics are complex across space and time, recent technological and analytical advances enable deeper understanding of their nature and ecological implications. While for some taxa, a great deal of information is known regarding the mechanistic underpinnings of these social processes, knowledge of these mechanisms in elasmobranchs is lacking. Here, we used an integrative and novel combination of direct observation, accelerometer biologgers, and recent advances in network analysis to better understand the mechanistic bases of individual-level differences in sociality (leadership, network attributes) and diel patterns of locomotor activity in a widespread marine predator, the lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris). We found that dynamic models of interaction based on Markov chains can accurately predict juvenile lemon shark social behavior and that lemon sharks did not occupy consistent positions within their network. Lemon sharks did however preferentially associate with specific group members, by sex as well as by similarity or nonsimilarity for a number of behavioral (nonsimilarity: leadership) and locomotor traits (similarity: proportion of time swimming “fast,” mean swim duration; nonsimilarity: proportion of swimming bursts/transitions between activity states). Our study provides some of the first information on the mechanistic bases of group living and personality in sharks and further, a potential experimental approach for studying fine-scale differences in behavior and locomotor patterns in difficult-to-study organisms.},

Probability of conception was related to the outcome of the immediately preceding pregnancy and the fate of the preceding offspring. After abortions or when an infant survived more than 6 months, a female needed more cycles to conceive than when an infant died within the first 6 months post partum. The degree of estrus synchrony within, but not between, one-male units influenced the probability of conception. Females experiencing conceptive estrus showed less synchrony than those experiencing nonconceptive estrus. The number of females simultaneously in estrus within a one-male unit was negatively correlated with the probability of conception. Within our captive population, group size and male and female age had no influence on the probability of conception. The results indicate that sperm may be a limited resource in the one-male reproductive units of hamadryas baboons. Female-female competition for conception may exist and should influence the demography of one-male units.},

	abstract = {Describing and quantifying animal personality is now an integral part of behavioural studies because individually distinctive behaviours have ecological and evolutionary consequences. Yet, to fully understand how personality traits may respond to selection, one must understand the underlying heritability and genetic correlations between traits. Previous studies have reported a moderate degree of heritability of personality traits but few of these studies have either been conducted in the wild or estimated the genetic correlations between personality traits. Estimating the additive genetic variance and covariance in the wild is crucial to understand the evolutionary potential of behavioural traits. Enhanced environmental variation could reduce heritability and genetic correlations thus leading to different evolutionary predictions. We estimated the additive genetic variance and covariance of docility in the trap, sociability (mirror image stimulation), and exploration and activity in two different contexts (open-field and mirror image simulation experiments) in a wild population of yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris). We estimated both heritability of behaviours and of personality traits and found non-zero additive genetic variance in these traits. We also found non-zero maternal, permanent environment, and year effects. Finally, we found four phenotypic correlations between traits, and one positive genetic correlation between activity in the open-field test and sociability. We also found permanent environment correlations between activity in both tests and docility and exploration in the MIS test. This is one of a handful of studies to adopt a quantitative genetic approach to explain variation in personality traits in the wild, and thus, provides important insights into the potential variance available for selection.

Here, we analyzed VNTRs upstream of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene in 11 different gibbon species. An abundance of truncated VNTR sequences and copy number differences were observed compared to those of human VNTR sequences. To better understand the biological role of these VNTRs, a luciferase activity assay was conducted and results indicated that selected VNTR sequences of the MAOA gene from human and three different gibbon species (Hylobates klossii, Hylobates lar, and Nomascus concolor) showed silencing ability. Together, these data could be useful for understanding the evolutionary history and functional significance of MAOA VNTR sequences in gibbon species., Les répétitions en tandem en nombre variable (VNTR) sont dispersées dans les génomes des primates et la variation à ces VNTR s’est accumulée au cours de l’évolution des primates.

Un grand nombre de séquences VNTR tronquées et de différences dans le nombre de répétitions ont été observées par rapport à ce qu’on observe chez les VNTR humains. Afin de mieux comprendre le rôle biologique de ces VNTR, un rapporteur faisant appel à la luciférase a été employé et a permis de constater que certaines séquences VNTR du gène MAOA chez l’humain et chez trois espèces de gibbons (Hylobates klossii, Hylobates lar et Nomascus concolor) pouvaient entraîner une inactivation du gène.

	abstract = {Aggressive behaviour is a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Despite of moderate heritability estimates, progress in identifying the genetic factors underlying aggressive behaviour has been limited. There are currently three genetic mouse models of high and low aggression created using selective breeding. This is the first study to offer a global transcriptomic characterization of the prefrontal cortex across all three genetic mouse models of aggression. A systems biology approach has been applied to transcriptomic data across the three pairs of selected inbred mouse strains (Turku Aggressive (TA) and Turku Non-Aggressive (TNA), Short Attack Latency (SAL) and Long Attack Latency (LAL) mice and North Carolina Aggressive (NC900) and North Carolina Non-Aggressive (NC100)), providing novel insight into the neurobiological mechanisms and genetics underlying aggression. First, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify modules of highly correlated genes associated with aggression. Probe sets belonging to gene modules uncovered by WGCNA were carried forward for network analysis using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). The RankProd non-parametric algorithm was then used to statistically evaluate expression differences across the genes belonging to modules significantly associated with aggression. IPA uncovered two pathways, involving NF-kB and MAPKs. The secondary RankProd analysis yielded 14 differentially expressed genes, some of which have previously been implicated in pathways associated with aggressive behaviour, such as Adrbk2. The results highlighted plausible candidate genes and gene networks implicated in aggression-related behaviour.},

Here we provide the historical and theoretical background for this argument and offer evidence of the importance of these ideas for understanding how animals (and other organisms that exhibit behavior) will respond to the rapid environmental changes caused by human activity. We offer examples from long-term research on the evolution of behavioral and other phenotypes in the adaptive radiation of the threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a radiation in which it is possible to infer ancestral patterns of behavioral plasticity relative to the post-glacial freshwater radiation in northwestern North America, and to use patterns of parallelism and contemporary evolution to understand adaptive causes of responses to environmental modification. Our work offers insights into the complexity of cognitive responses to environmental change, and into the importance of examining multiple aspects of the phenotype simultaneously, if we are to understand how behavioral shifts contribute to the persistence of populations and to subsequent evolution. We conclude by discussing the origins of apparent novelties induced by environmental shifts, and the importance of accounting for geographic variation within species if we are to accurately anticipate the effects of anthropogenic environmental modification on the persistence and evolution of animals.},

	abstract = {Many species are spatially and socially organized, with complex social organizations and dispersal patterns that are increasingly documented. Social species typically consist of small age-structured units, where a limited number of individuals monopolize reproduction and exhibit complex mating strategies. Here, we model social groups as age-structured units and investigate the genetic consequences of social structure under distinct mating strategies commonly found in mammals. Our results show that sociality maximizes genotypic diversity, which contradicts the belief that social groups are necessarily subject to strong genetic drift and at high risk of inbreeding depression. Social structure generates an excess of genotypic diversity. This is commonly observed in ecological studies but rarely reported in population genetic studies that ignore social structure. This heterozygosity excess, when detected, is often interpreted as a consequence of inbreeding avoidance mechanisms, but we show that it can occur even in the absence of such mechanisms. Many seemly contradictory results from ecology and population genetics can be reconciled by genetic models that include the complexities of social species. We find that such discrepancies can be explained by the intrinsic properties of social groups and by the sampling strategies of real populations. In particular, the number of social groups and the nature of the individuals that compose samples (e.g., nonreproductive and reproductive individuals) are key factors in generating outbreeding signatures. Sociality is an important component of population structure that needs to be revisited by ecologists and population geneticists alike.},

	abstract = {Canines represent an essential component of the dentition for any heterodont mammal. In primates, like many other mammals, canines are frequently used as weapons. Hence, tooth size and wear may have significant implications for fighting ability, and consequently for social dominance rank, reproductive success, and fitness. We evaluated sources of variance in canine growth and length in a well-studied wild primate population because of the potential importance of canines for male reproductive success in many primates. Specifically, we measured maxillary canine length in 80 wild male baboons (aged 5.04–20.45 years) from the Amboseli ecosystem in southern Kenya, and examined its relationship with maturation, age, and social dominance rank. In our analysis of maturation, we compared food-enhanced baboons (those that fed part time at a refuse pit associated with a tourist lodge) with wild-feeding males, and found that food-enhanced males achieved long canines earlier than wild-feeding males. Among adult males, canine length decreased with age because of tooth wear. We found some evidence that, after controlling for age, longer canines were associated with higher adult dominance rank (accounting for 9\% of the variance in rank), but only among relatively high-ranking males. This result supports the idea that social rank, and thus reproductive success and fitness, may depend in part on fighting ability mediated by canine size.},

	abstract = {As in other highly sexually dimorphic, group-living animals, reproduction in gorillas has been largely viewed as the outcome of competition among males. However, females may exert choice via dispersal decisions or choice of partner in multimale groups, and males may also mate selectively. Here, we examine the paternity of 79 wild mountain gorilla offspring born into four groups characterized by stable dominance hierarchies and the presence of mature offspring of the dominant male. We found that on average the dominant male sires the majority (72 \%) of the offspring in stable multimale groups and subordinate males also produce offspring, particularly when dominant males become older or the number of competing males increases. Although expected to disperse to avoid inbreeding, only half of the maturing daughters of dominant males left the group in which their father maintained dominance. However, in all five cases of reproduction by a resident daughter of a dominant male, a subordinate male was the sire of the offspring. As females commonly initiate and end copulations, and dominant males may prefer mating with fully mature females, both male and female mate preferences in addition to male competition apparently play a role in reproductive patterns in multimale groups, emphasizing the complexity of social dynamics in one of our closest living relatives.},

Additionally, social experience can influence both the ability to communicate effectively and performance in cognitive tasks within an individual’s lifetime, consistent with phenotypic plasticity in these traits. Historically, research in animal cognition and animal communication has often addressed these traits independently, despite potential commonalities in social function and underlying mechanisms of the brain. Integrating research on animal communication and cognition will provide a more comprehensive understanding of how the social environment may shape behavior and specializations of the brain for sociality through both evolutionary and developmental processes. This selective review of research on the impacts of social dynamics on cognition and communication in animals aims to highlight areas for future research at both the ultimate and proximate levels. In particular, additional work on the effects of the social environment on cognitive performance over an individual’s lifetime, and comparative studies of specialized abilities for communication, should be pursued.},

Early research conducted in captivity showed that losing fights can increase glucocorticoid (GC) secretion, a general response to stress. Because GCs can suppress reproduction, it has been widely argued that chronic stress might underlie reproductive suppression of social subordinates in cooperative breeders. Contradicting this hypothesis, recent studies of cooperative breeders in the wild show that dominant individuals have elevated GCs more often than do subordinates. The findings that elevated GCs can be a consequence of subordination or a cost of dominance complicate the conventional view of social stress, with broad ramifications for the evolution of dominance and reproductive suppression.},

	abstract = {Socioecological theory predicts that aggressive feeding competition is associated with linear dominance hierarchies and reproductive advantages for high-ranking females. Female blue monkeys contest fruits and have a linear dominance hierarchy, yet previous research has shown no evidence that high-ranking females benefit from greater feeding success or fertility. Here, we assess whether individuals differ in fecal glucocorticoid (fGC) excretion and examine proximate determinants of such differences to infer potential fitness correlates of rank, using data collected from two study groups in the Kakamega Forest, Kenya. We found that higher ranking females had preferential access to fruits in both groups, although the behavioral mechanisms leading to this effect varied between groups. Despite a consistent rank difference in feeding on fruits, an overall rank effect on fGCs emerged in only one group; females of this group spent comparatively more time feeding on fruits, fruits accounted for a greater proportion of the diet, and females engaged in more frequent food-related agonism. In addition, more females in this group were lactating during a period of low fruit availability, when rank effects on fGCs were particularly strong. Regardless of fruit availability, among lactating females of both groups higher rank was associated with lower fGC levels, indicating lower energetic stress in higher ranking females when energy demands were particularly high. Individual rates of agonism, a potential psychological stressor, were unrelated to fGCs at all times. After we accounted for rates of agonism and feeding on fruits, females of one group who groomed others more had lower fGCs, suggesting that variable social coping behavior can contribute to fGC variation in some groups. This study provides the first empirical evidence that high-ranking female blue monkeys may obtain fitness benefits from their social status, by gaining priority of access to fruits during critical times in the reproductive cycle.

Studies of social bonds and their fitness benefits have not been investigated outside primates, and are confounded by the relatedness between individuals in primate groups. Bonds may arise from kin selection and inclusive fitness rather than through direct benefits of association. However, female equids live in long-term social groups with unrelated members. We present 4 years of behavioral data, which demonstrate that social integration between unrelated females increases both foal birth rates and survival, independent of maternal habitat quality, social group type, dominance status, and age. Also, we show that such social integration reduces harassment by males. Consequently, social integration has strong direct fitness consequences between nonrelatives, suggesting that social bonds can evolve based on these direct benefits alone. Our results support recent studies highlighting the importance of direct benefits in maintaining cooperative behavior, while controlling for the confounding influence of kinship.},

	abstract = {Fecal testosterone and cortisol levels were analyzed from six wild male muriquis (Brachyteles arachnoides) over a 19-month period at the Estação Biológica de Caratinga in Minas Gerais, Brazil, to investigate the hormonal correlates of seasonal sexual behavior and environmental conditions. Group mean testosterone levels based on weekly samples from the six males did not differ between copulatory and noncopulatory periods or between rainy and dry seasons. Cortisol levels did change with copulatory periods, and were significantly higher during the second dry season, when mating continued following an exceptionally heavy rainy season, than during the first dry season, when mating ceased. Males exhibited individual variation in the timing of their hormone shifts relative to their sexual activity, but neither hormone levels nor sexual activity were related to male age. Despite individual differences in the timing of testosterone fluctuations around the onset and offset of the copulatory season, all males exhibited elevated cortisol concentrations following a slight increase in testosterone at the beginning of the copulatory season. Both the lack of significant changes in testosterone levels with the onset of the rainy and copulatory season and the lack of prebreeding increases in cortisol may be related to the low levels of overt aggression displayed by male muriquis over access to mates.},

	abstract = {Environmental conditions may influence fecal glucocorticoid metabolite measurements if feces cannot be collected immediately after deposition. To evaluate the influence of environmental conditions on fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations, we exposed fresh fecal samples to 1 of 5 simulated conditions: (1) room temperature (22 °C), (2) high heat (38 °C), (3) alternating high heat and room temperature cycle, (4) alternating freezing (−20 °C) and room temperature cycle, and (5) simulated rainfall (0.85 cm every other day at 22 °C) for 7 days. We collected fresh white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) feces at various times pre- and post-adrenocorticotropin injection to provide samples with initially low (n=5), medium (n=5), and high (n=5) glucocorticoid concentrations. Feces were mixed thoroughly and then allocated into five 10-g samples. Also, a 5-g sub-sample was taken from each fecal mass prior to treatment and stored at −20 °C until assayed. We subsampled from all treatments once every 24-h for 7 days. Fecal samples were assayed using [125I]corticosterone radioimmunoassay kits. Fecal glucocorticoid metabolites in all three groups in the simulated rainfall treatment and the low group in the alternating freezing and room temperature treatment increased significantly over the 7-day period. We believe increased microbial metabolism of fecal glucocorticoids may partly explain these results. Other biochemical processes (e.g., cleavage of conjugate side groups from hormone metabolites by non-microbial action or release of glucocorticoids from lipid micelles) may also have increased fecal glucocorticoid measurements. Our findings suggest that fecal samples exposed to rainfall for one week may artificially inflate fecal glucocorticoid measurements. Thus, researchers should recognize the potential bias when collecting fecal samples exposed to rainfall. Non-fresh samples may prove useful when care is taken to address the elevation in immunoreactive glucocorticoid concentrations.},

	abstract = {Endocrine profiles were investigated in wild and captive mongoose lemurs (\textit{Eulemur mongoz}; Lemuridae) by analysing faecal progestagens and oestrogens. Oestrous cycle characterization was not possible, as most females appeared to conceive during the first oestrus of the breeding season. Conception was preceded by a pseudo-oestrus with no discernible luteal phase. Pseudo-oestrus and oestrus identification was possible by investigating the oestrogen : progestagen ratio. Pregnancy was reliably determined approximately 47 days after conception, when progestagen and oestrogen excretion increased above breeding season concentrations. Gestation was further characterized by high progestagen concentrations and a decline in oestrogen excretion 70\&\#8211;80 days after conception. Post partum, progestagens declined, but oestrogen excretion increased to exceed breeding season concentrations. In the wild group, a nulliparous daughter conceived while still a member of her natal group and aborted after 70\&\#8211;80 days of pregnancy at which time progestagens had declined but oestrogens remained high. Comparisons with other strepsirhine primates suggest that pseudo-oestrus followed by conception at first oestrus may be prevalent in lemurs. Gestational progesterone profiles vary between species, but a delayed increase in oestrogens during pregnancy could be common to all strepsirhines, although oestrogen levels during the final trimester of pregnancy differ between lemurs and lorises. Methodological investigations showed that prolonged storage of faeces in ethanol is viable and that the presence of undigested vegetable matter in the faecal pellets had no effect on the interpretation of hormone profiles.},

	abstract = {This paper reports field and laboratory tests of serial sampling, solid phase extraction, and microradioimmunoassay methods for the collection, preservation, and analysis of fecal steroids. The field study was conducted in a troop of 87 yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus) in the Tana River Primate Reserve, Kenya. Serial samples of four focal females and opportunistic sampling of 18 additional females over 22 days of sampling yielded a total of 62 samples, X = 3.1 ± 0.4/day, demonstrating the feasibility of regular field collection and extraction. Estradiol and progesterone concentrations in the field-extracted samples exhibited high recovery and statistically significant correlations (P {\textless} 0.05) with concentrations in the lab-extracted samples, suggesting that solid phase extraction could provide a useful alternative to freezing in sites where electricity or liquid nitrogen is not available. Tests of microradioimmunoassays demonstrated that these assays were sensitive, accurate, and precise when applied to the assay of fecal extracts, providing estimates of ovarian steroids that varied significantly with reproductive state. The demonstration that testosterone could be accurately and reliably assayed in fecal extracts suggests that these techniques also could be applied to the study of male reproductive function. Parallels between fecal profiles of cycling and pregnant baboons with patterns reported for serum steroids in baboons suggest that fecal steroids might be useful in distinguishing amenorrhea from early pregnancy in free-ranging baboons as well as in species lacking external indices of reproductive state. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {The claim that dominance rank determines male mating success in polygamous primate groups is controversial. One argument against the claim is that spurious correlations are often obtained between dominance rank and mating success as a result of the confounding effects of age. Mating data from 32 studies of primate behaviour, totalling 75 study groups, were collated to test this criticism and investigate the determinants of observed variation in the correlation coefficient values. Despite conflicting reports, a reliable positive relationship between male dominance rank and mating success amongst animals of the same age class is seen. Furthermore, the variation in correlation coefficient values is significantly negatively related to the number of males in the group (the single exception being highly dimorphic primate species, where instead the correlation coefficient is positively related to the number of females). The intensity of the effect of the number of males is most severe in seasonal breeders. These results indicate that the relationship between dominance rank and mating success appears to be a function of the level of competition that males face in the group for access to cycling females. Data on genetic paternity indicate that these results hold even for absolute measures of reproductive success.},

The study group inhabits the lowlands of the northern Rift Valley in Ethiopia and has been under observation for over 1,200 hr, on and off, since October 1996. Here we report observations from August and September 2002 of the consequences of two takeovers of known females with black infants. After the first takeover, the respective infant disappeared and was presumed dead within 11 days of the takeover. After the second takeover, the infant incurred repeated severe aggression from its mother's new leader male and eventually died 4 days after the takeover. We interpret these findings as support for the sexual selection hypothesis regarding male infanticide. We suggest that hamadryas leader males usually protect infants born into their units, but may withhold this protection–or even directly attack and kill infants–after takeovers. Am. J.

	abstract = {Lactating female chacma baboons, Papio cynocephalus ursinus, maintain close associations, or ‘friendships’, with particular males that may protect infants from sexually selected infanticide by a newly immigrated alpha male. In a 2-year study, we sought evidence of female–female competition for male friends in cases where two mothers maintained friendships with the same male simultaneously. In this context, relative competitive abilities of the rival females influenced social access to the shared male friend: dominant females maintained higher levels of close proximity and allogrooming with the male than their subordinate counterparts. This disparity was greatest when younger dominant females and older subordinate females shared a male friend. This pattern resulted from social displacement: subordinate females experienced a significant decrease in time spent near the male friend immediately after a dominant female began associating with him (but the converse was not true). Changes in time male–female friends spent near one another were due primarily to changes in the behaviour of the females. Females may compete for friends based on male rank and probability of paternity of their current infants. Evidence that lactating females may pursue alternative anti-infanticide strategies besides friendship formation came from two sources. First, subordinate females displaced from a friendship made compensatory changes in their relationships with the potentially infanticidal alpha male: spatial proximity and the rate of contact with him fell significantly in the period immediately following displacement. Second, across the entire sample of friendships, female social behaviour and age were significantly correlated. Compared to younger mothers, older females showed: (1) a smaller relative contribution to maintaining close proximity to the male friend; (2) less close proximity to the male friend; and (3) greater proximity to relatives (this association applied to higher-ranking females). Thus, avoidance of infanticidal threat and protective association with maternal kin may constitute two alternative counterstrategies for some lactating females.},

	abstract = {Infanticide by primate males was considered rare if groups contain more than one adult male because, owing to lower paternity certainty, a male should be less likely to benefit from infanticide. Guided by recent evidence for strong variation of infanticide in primate multi-male groups, we modelled the conditions for when infanticide should occur for a group with a resident and an immigrant male. Setting the parameters (e.g. infant mortality, reduction of interbirth interval, life-time reproductive success, genetic representation) to fit the conditions most commonly found in nature, we develop a game-theoretic model to explore the influence of age and dominance on the occurrence of infanticide and infant defence. Male age strongly impacts the likelihood of an attack which is modified by the father's defence. If the new male is dominant he is likely to attack under most circumstances whereas a subordinate male will only attack if the father does not defend. These model scenarios fit the conditions under which infanticide is known to occur in primate multi-male groups and offer an explanation why infanticide is common in some multi-male groups and rare in others. Overall, the benefits for infanticidal males are strongly governed by a reduced interbirth interval while advantages via improved genetic representation in the gene pool contribute but a minor fraction.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1001862107},
	abstract = {The apparent rarity of contingent cooperation in animals has convinced many investigators that such reciprocity is unimportant, stimulating consideration of alternative explanations for cooperation, such as by-product mutualism and biological markets motivated by the likelihood of immediate reward. Nevertheless, there is also limited evidence that animals do sometimes rely on memory of recent interactions when behaving altruistically toward others. Here we describe a playback experiment conducted on wild female baboons, suggesting that contingent cooperation may occur among unrelated individuals, even when there is a temporal delay between the two cooperative acts. Hearing the recruitment call of an unrelated recent grooming partner caused subjects to move in the direction of the loudspeaker and approach their former partner, particularly when this partner had an infant. When the subject and her partner were close kin no such effect was observed. Subjects’ responses were not influenced by any type of recent interaction, because prior grooming and prior aggression influenced their behavior in qualitatively different ways. Similarly, their responses were not prompted only by the motivation to resume friendly interactions, because prior grooming alone did not elicit approach. Instead, subjects were most likely to approach their former grooming partner when they had also heard her recruitment call. Results suggest that at least some forms of cooperation in animals may be based on memory of specific recent interactions.},

Unlike simple Mendelian characteristics, genetic variance for behavioral dimensions and disorders rarely accounts for more than half of the phenotypic variance, and multiple genes with small effects appear to be involved rather than one or two major genes. Genetic research on behavior will be transformed by techniques of molecular biology that can be used to identify DNA sequences responsible for behavioral variation. However, the importance of nongenetic factors and the multigenetic control of behavior require new strategies to detect DNA markers that account for small amounts of behavioral variation.},

	abstract = {The probability of ovulation in a number of primate species is associated with both visual and auditory cues. We use 18-month behavioral data from two chacma baboon troops to provide the first systematic assessment of the possibility that olfactory cues are also involved. Using variance in the rate of olfactory inspection by males as a proxy for changes in the intensity of female vaginal odor, we found that rates of inspection were broadly correlated with changes in female fertility. Males inspected cycling females significantly more than anovulatory, noncycling females and swelling females significantly more than nonswollen cycling females. Rates of inspection peaked around the time at which males first started guarding females and were sustained until the detumescence of the female's sexual skin. We conclude, therefore, that olfactory cues represent one component of a multimodal signal of ovulation in chacma baboons. The possible reasons for such a multimodal signal are discussed. Am. J.

	abstract = {Abstract  Theory predicts that females in species with matrilineal dominance hierarchies should use nepotistic support systems to maintain
their family’s rank. Female Old World monkeys, however, form alliances against other females at surprisingly low rates. Nonetheless,
in many species, females utter threat vocalizations when observing others’ disputes, suggesting that these vocalizations may
function as ‘vocal alliances’. We describe a playback experiment testing the efficacy of vocal alliances in free-ranging female
baboons. Subjects were played the same female’s threat-grunts under three separate conditions: after being threatened by the
signaller’s close relative to mimic kin support, after being threatened by a female maternally unrelated to the signaller
to mimic non-kin support, and after a friendly interaction with the signaller’s close relative as a control. Subjects responded
more strongly to the playback and avoided the signaller and her matrilineal relatives for a longer period of time in kin support
trials than in either non-kin support or no aggression trials. In contrast, there was no difference in subjects’ behaviour
between non-kin support and no aggression trials. These results corroborate observational data showing that vocal support
occurs at a higher rate than physical support in female baboons, and that kin are more likely to provide vocal support than
non-kin. We conclude that vocal support plays a similar role as physical support in the alliances of female baboons.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1007411107},
	abstract = {A large body of research has demonstrated that variation in competitive behavior across species and individuals is linked to variation in physiology. In particular, rapid changes in testosterone and cortisol during competition differ according to an individual's or species’ psychological and behavioral responses to competition. This suggests that among pairs of species in which there are behavioral differences in competition, there should also be differences in the endocrine shifts surrounding competition. We tested this hypothesis by presenting humans’ closest living relatives, chimpanzees () and bonobos (), with a dyadic food competition and measuring their salivary testosterone and cortisol levels. Given that chimpanzees and bonobos differ markedly in their food-sharing behavior, we predicted that they would differ in their rapid endocrine shifts. We found that in both species, males showed an anticipatory decrease (relative to baseline) in steroids when placed with a partner in a situation in which the two individuals shared food, and an anticipatory increase when placed with a partner in a situation in which the dominant individual obtained more food. The species differed, however, in terms of which hormone was affected; in bonobo males the shifts occurred in cortisol, whereas in chimpanzee males the shifts occurred in testosterone. Thus, in anticipation of an identical competition, bonobo and chimpanzee males showed differential endocrine shifts, perhaps due to differences in perception of the situation, that is, viewing the event either as a stressor or a dominance contest. In turn, common selection pressures in human evolution may have acted on the psychology and the endocrinology of our competitive behavior.},

This review outlines work from other relevant disciplines, including evolutionary economics, cognitive science and neurophysiology, to illustrate how these can be used to build a more general theoretical framework, incorporating notions of embodied and distributed cognition, in which to situate questions concerning the evolution of primate social cognition.},

However, the extent to which energetic factors constrain gonadal function in male hominoids is not clear. We examined the effects of both acute and chronic variation in energy availability on urinary testosterone (T) levels in adult male chimpanzees. Acute changes in energy availability, which were assayed by means of observational data on feeding behavior, did not result in decreased T production for 11 individuals at Kibale National Park, Uganda. Chronic energy shortages, on the other hand, may be associated with lower T levels in this population. Adult males in Kibale (n=11), who maintain suboptimal access to energy, exhibit significantly lower urinary T levels than males in captivity (n=11), who are more sedentary and better fed. These results suggest that data on hormonal function in captive chimpanzees should be interpreted with caution because individuals may produce T at levels well above those that are typical in the wild. They also suggest that short-term variations in T levels in male hominoids are more likely to be explained by social factors than by energetic ones.},

In addition, another sexually dimorphic characteristic appears to be the presence of a pubertal growth spurt in body weight, and possibly CRL, in male but not female baboons. Serum testosterone levels rose during male development; however, there was a progressive decrease in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels indicating the absence of adrenarche. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and its major binding protein, IGFBP-3, both rose during pubertal development; however, a simultaneous rise in the IGF-I:IGFBP-3 molar ratio suggests other factors may enhance the bioactivity of IGF-I during puberty. A distinct rise in serum osteocalcin levels was also associated with puberty in male baboons. These growth and hormonal changes during puberty in the hamadryas baboon indicate that this species provides a close primate model for human puberty.},

In the first experiment, two heterosexual groups, containing adult males unfamiliar to the other group, were merged. The two groups fought, and the smaller group was defeated. The alpha and beta males of the defeated group were singled out for repeated attack and both showed significant drops in circulating levels of testosterone. Both males were removed from the group during the first day, but testosterone levels did not recover to baseline levels for several days. The alpha male of the victorious group, on the other hand, showed a significant rise in testosterone, which was apparent only on the day following the merger.
In order to study the influence of previous social familiarity on male reception into a group, another group was formed by removing males from the victorious group and placing them in a separate enclosure. The males in the new group established a dominance hierarchy unrelated to their previous social ranks with one another. Three months later, each of the six adult males remaining in the parent group was individually introduced into the new group for one day or less.
Each of the males introduced into the new group accepted a social position at the lower end of the dominance hierarchy without regard to his previous rank relationships with the host males when they were all in the parent group.
Even the alpha and beta males of the parent group were relegated to low rank positions in the new group, despite having ranked over each of the host males since birth.
In contrast to the aggression directed at the unfamiliar males in the first experiment, a minimum of aggression was directed to the familiar males introduced into the new group in the second experiment. Although the males introduced accepted low social ranks, it appeared that each was readily integrated into the group with a minimum of aggressive interaction during the time he was scheduled to remain in the group. There were no significant changes in circulating levels of testosterone in any of the males during the introductions of familiar males to one another.},

	title = {The {Serotonin} {Transporter} and {Behavior} {Gene}*{Environment} {Interactions}},
	abstract = {The association between the cerebral serotonin system and human behavior is only incompletely
understood. Great emphasis has been placed on the serotonin transporter, which is responsible
for the regulation of the interstitial serotonin levels in the brain. The aim of this thesis was to
uncover the association between the serotonin transporter and serotonin 2A receptors, as
measured in vivo with [11C]DASB/[18F]altanserin and positron emission tomography, and
genetic, environmental, and personality characteristics. The studies were conducted in large
cohorts of healthy participants who underwent personality assessments with a well-known selfadministered
questionnaire: the Revised Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness Personality
Inventory (NEO-PI-R). Furthermore, blood samples from the participants were used for
determination of a common polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter
gene, the 5-HTTLPR, and of a common single-nucleotide polymorphism in the CLOCK gene,
3111T/C, which is involved in the regulation of circadian rhythm.
Participants with lower serotonin transporter binding, and therefore presumably higher interstitial
serotonin levels, had a more open personality; this finding was not directly associated with
specific alleles of the 5-HTTLPR. A circannual fluctuation in serotonin transporter binding was
observed, with highest levels during the winter, and lower levels in summertime. In the putamen,
a season*genotype interaction was observed: serotonin transporter binding only varied with
season in carriers of the short 5-HTTLPR allele. I then explored if a genetic polymorphism
related to the circadian rhythm, the 3111T/C, was associated with serotonin pre- or postsynaptic
binding in vivo but no effect on circannual fluctuations in serotonin transporter binding or
serotonin 2A receptor binding was observed.
In conclusion, the in vivo cerebral serotonin transporter binding is related to the openness versus
rigidity of the personality. The serotonin system in carriers of the short 5-HTTLPR allele is more
sensitive to a particular environmental stressor, seasonal fluctuations in daylight times.},

	abstract = {Potentiation of serotonergic transmission increases cognitive flexibility, but can in other circumstances increase sensitivity to stressful environmental cues. The personality trait Openness to Experience reflects and is also associated with an increased risk for mood disorders. We hypothesized that the personality trait has an association with a biomarker of serotonergic transmission, the plasma membrane serotonin transporter (5-HTT). In 50 healthy volunteers, we tested for correlations between scores on the NEO-PI-R scale Openness to Experience and its subscales, and cerebral binding of the 5-HTT selective PET radioligand [11C]DASB. Subjects were genotyped for the 5-HTT long/short polymorphism, and for a single nucleotide polymorphism in the long allele, designated LA/LG. Midbrain [11C]DASB binding correlated negatively with scores for Openness to Experience  and its two subscales, Openness to Actions and Openness to Values. The latter subscore was negatively correlated with [11C]DASB binding in all brain regions in which [11C]DASB binding was quantified. Genetic analysis showed that homozygote LA carriers had significantly higher [11C]DASB binding in the caudate nucleus, but no significant differences in openness scores. Thus, high scores in personality facets indicative of cognitive flexibility and openness to change are associated with lower [11C]DASB binding. Lower abundance of 5-HTT sites may result in potentiation of serotonergic signaling, which occurs during treatment with SSRIs. We speculate that the set-point of serotonergic signaling in an individual represents a trade-off between flexibility and vulnerability when exposed to environmental stress.},

	abstract = {Explanations of the evolution of canine tooth size sexual dimorphism in primates implicitly assume that male canine size is the primary target of natural or sexual selection, even though there is substantial unexplained variation in female canine size. Here we demonstrate that the canines of both males and females are relatively larger in species where agonistic interactions are more likely to escalate. Hence, the canine teeth of both sexes are influenced by selection for the development of weaponry, though the nature of the selection (natural or sexual) favoring development of the canines as weapons depends on the objects of competition (mates vs. food, for example). However, we also suggest that where the outcome of fights is typically determined between coalitions of individuals, selection for weaponry is reduced, even though agonistic competition can be very intense. Coalitionary aggression between males occurs in only a handful of anthropoid primates, but it is common among female anthropoids, and helps explain, in part, the extreme sexual dimorphism in the canine teeth of a number of catarrhine species. This is the first demonstration that cooperation among animals may affect their morphology. The lack of sexual dimorphism in canine size among prosimian primates is also consistent with the model. This analysis demonstrates that a better understanding of the interspecific variation in sexual dimorphism among primates is gained by considering behavioral variation in both sexes.},

But in the twenty-five years since its publication, new theories and research techniques for studying the Primate order have been developed, debated, and tested, forcing scientists to revise their understanding of our closest living relatives.Intended as a sequel to Primate Societies, The Evolution of Primate Societies compiles thirty-one chapters that review the current state of knowledge regarding the behavior of nonhuman primates. Chapters are written by the leading authorities in the field and organized around four major adaptive problems primates face as they strive to grow, maintain themselves, and reproduce in the wild. The inclusion of chapters on the behavior of humans at the end of each major section represents one particularly novel aspect of the book, and it will remind readers what we can learn about ourselves through research on nonhuman primates. The final section highlights some of the innovative and cutting-edge research designed to reveal the similarities and differences between nonhuman and human primate cognition. The Evolution of Primate Societies will be every bit the landmark publication its predecessor has been.},

Regardless of rank, all males were more likely to participate in chases or physical fights if their opponents rank was similar to their own. Most chases and fights, including those that led to injuries, were also between similarly-ranked males. The rate of both aggressive displays and approach-retreat interactions increased in the weeks before rank reversals, suggesting that rank challenges were preceded by a period when males assessed each others competitive ability and/or motivation. Aggressive displays between disparately-ranked opponents occurred most frequently in contests involving resources of high fitness value: the defense of meat, the defense of estrous females, and the protection of infants against infanticidal attacks. Silent displays were more likely to occur in these three contexts than were displays that occurred as part of more slowly escalating interactions, in which opponents first exchanged calls. Results suggest that competitive encounters among male baboons follow patterns predicted by evolutionary game theory.},

Successful identification of associations between genetic markers and aggression would contribute to understanding the neurobiology of antisocial behavior and potentially provide useful tools for risk prediction and therapeutic targets for high-risk groups of patients and offenders. We systematically reviewed the literature and assessed the evidence on genetic association studies of aggression and related outcomes in order to provide a field synopsis. We searched PubMed and Huge Navigator databases and sought additional data through reviewing reference lists and correspondence with investigators. Genetic association studies were included if outcome data on aggression or violent behavior either as a binary outcome or as a quantitative trait were provided. From 1331 potentially relevant investigations, 185 studies constituting 277 independent associations on 31 genes fulfilled the predetermined selection criteria. Data from variants investigated in three or more samples were combined in meta-analyses and potential sources of heterogeneity were investigated using subgroup analyses. In the primary analyses, which used relaxed inclusion criteria, we found no association between any polymorphism analyzed and aggression at the 5\% level of significance. Subgroup analyses, including by severity of outcome, age group, characteristics of the sample and ethnicity, did not demonstrate any consistent findings. Current evidence does not support the use of such genes to predict dangerousness or as markers for therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {Discerning the relative roles of adaptive and nonadaptive processes in generating differences among populations and species, as well as how these processes interact, is a fundamental aim in biology. Both genetic and phenotypic divergence across populations can be the product of limited dispersal and gradual genetic drift across populations (isolation by distance), of colonization history and founder effects (isolation by colonization) or of adaptation to different environments preventing migration between populations (isolation by adaptation). Here, we attempt to differentiate between these processes using island populations of Berthelot's pipit (Anthus berthelotii), a passerine bird endemic to three Atlantic archipelagos. Using microsatellite markers and approximate Bayesian computation, we reveal that the northward colonization of this species ca. 8500 years ago resulted in genetic bottlenecks in the colonized archipelagos. We then show that high levels of genetic structure exist across archipelagos and that these are consistent with a pattern of isolation by colonization, but not with isolation by distance or adaptation. Finally, we show that substantial morphological divergence also exists and that this is strongly concordant with patterns of genetic structure and bottleneck history, but not with environmental differences or geographic distance. Overall, our data suggest that founder effects are responsible for both genetic and phenotypic changes across archipelagos. Our findings provide a rare example of how founder effects can persist over evolutionary timescales and suggest that they may play an important role in the early stages of speciation.},

	abstract = {The assessment of genetic architecture and selection history in genes for behavioural traits is fundamental to our understanding of how these traits evolve. The dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) gene is a prime candidate for explaining genetic variation in novelty seeking behaviour, a commonly assayed personality trait in animals. Previously, we showed that a single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 3 of this gene is associated with exploratory behaviour in at least one of four Western European great tit (Parus major) populations. These heterogeneous association results were explained by potential variable linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns between this marker and the causal variant or by other genetic or environmental differences among the populations. Different adaptive histories are further hypothesized to have contributed to these population differences. Here, we genotyped 98 polymorphisms of the complete DRD4 gene including the flanking regions for 595 individuals of the four populations. We show that the LD structure, specifically around the original exon 3 SNP is conserved across the four populations and does not explain the heterogeneous association results. Study-wide significant associations with exploratory behaviour were detected in more than one haplotype block around exon 2, 3 and 4 in two of the four tested populations with different allele effect models. This indicates genetic heterogeneity in the association between multiple DRD4 polymorphisms and exploratory behaviour across populations. The association signals were in or close to regions with signatures of positive selection. We therefore hypothesize that variation in exploratory and other dopamine-related behaviour evolves locally by occasional adaptive shifts in the frequency of underlying genetic variants.},

	abstract = {Polymorphisms in the dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4) have been related to individual variation in novelty-seeking or exploratory behaviour in a variety of animals, including humans. Recently, the human DRD4 orthologue was sequenced in a wild bird, the great tit (Parus major) and a single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 3 of this gene (SNP830) was shown to be associated with variation in exploratory behaviour of lab-raised individuals originating from a single wild population. Here we test the generality of this finding in a large sample of free-living individuals from four European great tit populations, including the originally sampled population. We demonstrate that the association between SNP830 genotype and exploratory behaviour also exists in free-living birds from the original population. However, in the other three populations we found only limited evidence for an association: in two populations the association appeared absent; while in one there was a nonsignificant tendency. We could not confirm a previously demonstrated interaction with another DRD4 polymorphism, a 15 bp indel in the promoter region (ID15). As yet unknown differences in genetic or environmental background could explain why the same genetic polymorphism (SNP830) has a substantial effect on exploratory behaviour in one population, explaining 4.5–5.8\% of the total variance—a large effect for a single gene influencing a complex behavioural trait—but not in three others. The confirmation of an association between SNP830 genotype and personality-related behaviour in a wild bird population warrants further research into potential fitness effects of the polymorphism, while also the population differences in the strength of the association deserve further investigation. Another important future challenge is the identification of additional loci influencing avian personality traits in the wild.},

We address this issue using candidate genes for behavioural traits that are expected to play a role in such colonization events. We identified and genotyped 16 polymorphisms in candidate genes for circadian rhythms, harm avoidance and migratory and exploratory behaviour in 12 paired urban and rural populations of the blackbird Turdus merula across the Western Palaearctic. An exonic microsatellite in the SERT gene, a candidate gene for harm avoidance behaviour, exhibited a highly significant association with habitat type in an analysis conducted across all populations. Genetic divergence at this locus was consistent in 10 of the 12 population pairs; this contrasts with previously reported stochastic genetic divergence between these populations at random markers. Our results indicate that behavioural traits related to harm avoidance and associated with the SERT polymorphism experience selection pressures during most blackbird urbanization events. These events thus appear to be influenced by homogeneous adaptive processes in addition to previously reported demographic founder events.},

Affirming and expanding earlier criticism, we demonstrate that inclusive fitness is instead a limited concept, which exists only for a small subset of evolutionary processes. Inclusive fitness assumes that personal fitness is the sum of additive components caused by individual actions. This assumption does not hold for the majority of evolutionary processes or scenarios. To sidestep this limitation, inclusive fitness theorists have proposed a method using linear regression. On the basis of this method, it is claimed that inclusive fitness theory (i) predicts the direction of allele frequency changes, (ii) reveals the reasons for these changes, (iii) is as general as natural selection, and (iv) provides a universal design principle for evolution. In this paper we evaluate these claims, and show that all of them are unfounded. If the objective is to analyze whether mutations that modify social behavior are favored or opposed by natural selection, then no aspect of inclusive fitness theory is needed.},

In version 6.0, MEGA now enables the inference of timetrees, as it implements the RelTime method for estimating divergence times for all branching points in a phylogeny. A new Timetree Wizard in MEGA6 facilitates this timetree inference by providing a graphical user interface (GUI) to specify the phylogeny and calibration constraints step-by-step. This version also contains enhanced algorithms to search for the optimal trees under evolutionary criteria and implements a more advanced memory management that can double the size of sequence data sets to which MEGA can be applied. Both GUI and command-line versions of MEGA6 can be downloaded from www.megasoftware.net free of charge.},

	abstract = {We investigated the mechanism of alliance formation among adult male savanna baboons by comparing the characteristics-of males that formed coalitions frequently with males that never or seldom took part in coalitions. We observed three groups: two of Papio cynocephalus cynocephalus in Amboseli National park Kenya, and one of P. c. anubis in the vicinity of Gilgil, Kenya. We considered four hypotheses: (1) Males must be familiar with each other, (2) males must have an affinitive bond, (3) males must have move than average experience, and (4) the combined fighting ability of the coalition partners relative to the fighting ability of their opponent determines the likelihood that a coalition is formed. We conclude that relative fighting ability forms the key factor in coalition formation. High-ranking males do not form coalitions often, since they hardly need them. Low-ranking males rarely form coalitions, since they cannot form effective coalitions among themselves. Affinity (''friendship'') may play a role as an additional factor. The relation of coalition formation with age and period of residence, which was found in several studies, can be explained largely by the correlation between these parameters and fighting ability.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) has been associated with seasonality both in patients with seasonal affective disorder and in the general population. METHOD: We used in vivo molecular imaging to measure cerebral serotonin transporter (5-HTT) binding in 57 healthy Scandinavians and related the outcome to season of the year and to the 5-HTTLPR carrier status. RESULTS: We found that the number of daylight minutes at the time of scanning correlated negatively with 5-HTT binding in the putamen and the caudate, with a similar tendency in the thalamus, whereas this association was not observed for the midbrain. Furthermore, in the putamen, an anatomic region with relatively dense serotonin innervation, we found a significant gene x daylight effect, such that there was a negative correlation between 5-HTT binding and daylight minutes in carriers of the short 5-HTTLPR allele but not in homozygote carriers of the long allele. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are in line with S-carriers having an increased response in neural circuits involved in emotional processing to stressful environmental stimuli but here demonstrated as a endophenotype with dynamic changes in serotonin reuptake.},

	title = {Fission and troop size in a mountain baboon population},
	volume = {53},
	abstract = {Baboon,Papio cynocephaluspopulations show a circumscribed range of troop sizes, dependent on features of the habitat that set limits on the ability of animals to balance their time budgets. To assess the proposal that a rising probability of troop fission is the mechanism underlying this it is first shown that (1) the distribution of troop sizes in two very different baboon populations, in the Drakensberg and at Amboseli, are not described by the null model of random allocation of individuals to troops (the Poisson process); and (2) data on troops undergoing or attempting fission support the hypothesis that the probability of fission increases with increasing troop size. A model was constructed that generated a distribution of troop size from an underlying, ‘pre-fission’ distribution by varying two parameters: the probability that a troop of given size will split, and the relative sizes of the two daughter troops that result if fission occurs. Both the Drakensberg and the Amboseli populations were adequately described by the model and it is concluded that the distribution of troop size in both populations is governed by fission in the manner proposed by Dunbar (1992,Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol.33, 35–49). The model also indicates that, relative to Amboseli, the probability of fission in the Drakensberg is very high, with all troops of more than 28 members eventually splitting. The hypothesis that low food availability accelerates fission in mountain baboons through the decreased foraging efficiency of larger troops was tested. Troops of a wide range of sizes allocated very similar amounts of time to foraging, foraged with the same efficiency, and travelled approximately the same distances to do so. It is concluded that fission in mountain baboons, being exacerbated neither by predation nor by inefficient foraging, may be caused directly by the inability of individuals to service social relationships in growing troops in the face of small amounts of time available for social interaction.},

Among the numerous biological factors that have been identified as increasing risk for antisocial behavior, one of the most well-supported has inexplicably received very little attention with regard to implications for explaining why maleness is such a robust predictor. That factor is the low activity form of the monoamine oxidase-A gene. A major reason for this inattention to the MAOA-L gene appears to be the failure to appreciate that its location on the X chromosome reflects the enormous biological disadvantage of the male compared to the female. This article, after presenting a brief overview of the research which establishes that MAOA-L is one of the most well-supported biological risk factors for antisocial behaviors, explained how the enormous male biological disadvantage related to the sex difference in the prevalence of MAOA-L and thus helped explain why maleness is the most robust predictor of antisocial behavior.},

This mutation is analogous to the cause of a rare human disorder, Brunner syndrome, characterized by complete MAO A deficiency and impulsive aggressiveness. Concurrent with previous studies of MAO A KO mice generated by insertional mutagenesis (‘Tg8’), MAOAA863T KO lack MAO A enzyme activity and display enhanced aggression toward intruder mice. MAOAA863T KO, however, exhibited lower locomotor activity in a novel, inescapable open field and similar immobility during tail suspension compared with wild type, observations which differ from reports of Tg8. These findings consolidate evidence linking MAO A to aggression and highlight subtle yet distinctive phenotypical characteristics.},

Tandem repeats have been shown to cause human disease, may play a variety of regulatory and evolutionary roles and are important laboratory and analytic tools. Extensive knowledge about pattern size, copy number, mutational history, etc. for tandem repeats has been limited by the inability to easily detect them in genomic sequence data. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for finding tandem repeats which works without the need to specify either the pattern or pattern size. We model tandem repeats by percent identity and frequency of indels between adjacent pattern copies and use statistically based recognition criteria. We demonstrate the algorithm's speed and its ability to detect tandem repeats that have undergone extensive mutational change by analyzing four sequences: the human frataxin gene, the human beta T cellreceptor locus sequence and two yeast chromosomes. These sequences range in size from 3 kb up to 700 kb. A World Wide Web server interface atc3.biomath.mssm.edu/trf.html has been established for automated use of the program.},

It is commonly viewed by the general public as an aberrant form of behavior, with situations of conflict pictured as unfavorable and stressful circumstances, brought about by amoral urges, in critical need of the cognitive control, and with negative consequences for all involved. This chapter focuses on the study of aggression. A comprehensive understanding of how biology, behavior, and environment intersect is paramount in the study of human violence and aggression.Studies of aggression, its motives, and its causes are of central interest to a wide range of academic disciplines—behavioral genetics, evolution, neuroscience, psychology, sociology, and criminology, to name just a few. Despite the wealth of empirical and theoretical attention, it is remarkable that a comprehensive synthesis of aggression has stubbornly remained elusive. As with any other characteristic, natural selection is assumed to enhance aggression's overall effectiveness. High ranking individuals are likely to display a favorable combination of strength, along with ability to titer their levels of aggression, to pick fights that are winnable, and to only compete in those that are worth it.},

	abstract = {Aggressive behaviors in animals, for example, threat, attack, and defense, are commonly related to competition over resources, competition over mating opportunities, or fights for survival. In this chapter, we focus on aggressive competition over mating opportunities, since this competition explains much of the distribution of weaponry and large body size, but also because this type of competition sheds light on the sex skew in the use of violence in mammals, including humans. Darwin (1871) termed this type of natural selection, where differences in reproductive success are caused by competition over mates, sexual selection. Not all species have a pronounced competition over mates, however. Instead, this aspect of sociality is ultimately determined by ecological factors. In species where competition over mates is rampant, this has evolutionary effects on weaponry and body size such that males commonly bear more vicious weapons and are larger than females. A review of sexual selection in mammals reveals how common aggressive competition over mating opportunities is in this group. Nearly half of all mammal species exhibit male-biased sexual size dimorphism, a pattern that is clearly linked to sexual selection. Sexual selection is also common in primates, where it has left clear historical imprints in body mass differences, in weaponry differences (canines), and also in brain structure differences. However, when comparing humans to our closest living primate relatives, it is clear that the degree of male sexual competition has decreased in the hominid lineage. Nevertheless, our species displays dimorphism, polygyny, and sex-specific use of violence typical of a sexually selected mammal. Understanding the biological background of aggressive behaviors is fundamental to understanding human aggression.},

	abstract = {From psychological and sociological standpoints, aggression is regarded as intentional behavior aimed at inflicting pain and manifested by hostility and attacking behaviors. In contrast, biologists define aggression as behavior associated with attack or escalation toward attack, omitting any stipulation about intentions and goals. Certain animal signals are strongly associated with escalation toward attack and have the same function as physical attack in intimidating opponents and winning contests, and ethologists therefore consider them an integral part of aggressive behavior. Aggressive signals have been molded by evolution to make them ever more effective in mediating interactions between the contestants. Early theoretical analyses of aggressive signaling suggested that signals could never be honest about fighting ability or aggressive intentions because weak individuals would exaggerate such signals whenever they were effective in influencing the behavior of opponents. More recent game theory models, however, demonstrate that given the right costs and constraints, aggressive signals are both reliable about strength and intentions and effective in influencing contest outcomes. Here, we review the role of signaling in lieu of physical violence, considering threat displays from an ethological perspective as an adaptive outcome of evolutionary selection pressures. Fighting prowess is conveyed by performance signals whose production is constrained by physical ability and thus limited to just some individuals, whereas aggressive intent is encoded in strategic signals that all signalers are able to produce. We illustrate recent advances in the study of aggressive signaling with case studies of charismatic taxa that employ a range of sensory modalities, viz. visual and chemical signaling in cephalopod behavior, and indicators of aggressive intent in the territorial calls of songbirds.},

	abstract = {Using aggressive behavior, animals of many species establish dominance hierarchies in both nature and the laboratory. Rank in these hierarchies influences many aspects of animals’ lives including their health, physiology, weight gain, genetic expression, and ability to reproduce and raise viable offspring. In this chapter, we define dominance relationships and dominance hierarchies, discuss several model species used in dominance studies, and consider factors that predict the outcomes of dominance encounters in dyads and small groups of animals. Researchers have shown that individual differences in attributes, as well as in states (recent behavioral experiences), influence the outcomes of dominance encounters in dyads. Attributes include physical, physiological, and genetic characteristics while states include recent experiences such as winning or losing earlier contests. However, surprisingly, we marshal experimental and theoretical evidence to demonstrate that these differences have significantly less or no ability to predict the outcomes of dominance encounters for animals in groups as small as three or four individuals. Given these results, we pose an alternative research question: How do animals of so many species form hierarchies with characteristic linear structures despite the relatively low predictability based upon individual differences? In answer to this question, we review the evidence for an alternative approach suggesting that dominance hierarchies are self-structuring. That is, we suggest that linear forms of organization in hierarchies emerge from several kinds of behavioral processes, or sequences of interaction, that are common across many different species of animals from ants to chickens and fish and even some primates. This new approach inspires a variety of further questions for research.},

	abstract = {Our understanding of the biological basis of aggression in all vertebrates, including humans, has been built largely upon discoveries first made in birds. A voluminous literature now indicates that hormonal mechanisms are shared between humans and a number of avian species. Research on genetics mechanisms in birds has lagged behind the more typical laboratory species because the necessary tools have been lacking until recently. Over the past 30 years, three major technical advances have propelled forward our understanding of the hormonal, neural, and genetic bases of aggression in birds: (1) the development of assays to measure plasma levels of hormones in free-living individuals, or “field endocrinology”; (2) the immunohistochemical labeling of immediate early gene products to map neural responses to social stimuli; and (3) the sequencing of the zebra finch genome, which makes available a tremendous set of genomic tools for studying gene sequences, expression, and chromosomal structure in species for which we already have large datasets on aggressive behavior. This combination of hormonal, neuroendocrine, and genetic tools has established songbirds as powerful models for understanding the neural basis and evolution of aggression in vertebrates. In this chapter, we discuss the contributions of field endocrinology toward a theoretical framework linking aggression with sex steroids, explore evidence that the neural substrates of aggression are conserved across vertebrate species, and describe a promising new songbird model for studying the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying aggression.},

Form of aggression (reactive, proactive, direct/physical, indirect/relational), method of assessment (laboratory observation, self-report, ratings by parents and teachers), and age of the subjects—all seem to be significant moderators of the magnitude of genetic and environmental influences on aggressive behavior. Neither study design (twin vs. sibling adoption design) nor sex (male vs. female) seems to impact the magnitude of the genetic and environmental influences on aggression. There is also some evidence of gene-environment interaction (G × E) from both twin/adoption studies and molecular genetic studies. Various measures of family adversity and social disadvantage have been found to moderate genetic influences on aggressive behavior. Findings from these G × E studies suggest that not all individuals will be affected to the same degree by experiences and exposures, and that genetic predispositions may have different effects depending on the environment.},

Early life risk factors, such as pregnancy and birth complications and intrauterine exposure to environmental toxins, appear to have a profound and enduring impact on the neuroregulatory systems mediating violence and aggression, yet the emergence of later adverse behavioral outcomes appears to be both complex and multidimensional.

	abstract = {Abstract: In mammals, fathers are facultative caretakers, and male care is expected to evolve only if it is directed towards related young. Yet, in several promiscuous primate societies, males seem to care for infants despite a presumably low paternity confidence. In cercopithecines, cohesive associations ('friendships') between a lactating female and an adult male are frequent and provide the female and her infant with protection against various sources of aggression, including infanticide. However, the benefits gained by males through such relationships remain unclear, in part, because the relatedness between males and their protected infants has rarely been examined. Moreover, little is known about the nature of the cues underlying kin discrimination by males in societies where females mate polyandrously. In this study, we combine behavioural and genetic data from wild chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) in Namibia to investigate (1) whether males are related to their friend's infant and (2) whether similarity between the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genotype of males and infants (potentially perceived through odour phenotype) favours the establishment of friendships. We first show that males share close genetic ties with their friend's infants, most often by having sired the infant. Secondly, we find that male-infant MHC (Class II-DRB) similarity, in contrast to paternity, does not predict male-infant associations. Overall, our results clarify the nature of the evolutionary benefits gained by males in these heterosexual associations, which can be considered as true paternal care. However, the proximate mechanisms underlying paternity recognition remain to be identified.},

	abstract = {The concept of dominance has contributed greatly to our understanding of social structure in animals. Over the past three decades, however, a variety of concepts and definitions of dominance have been introduced, leading to an ongoing debate about the usefulness and meaning of the concept. Criticisms aimed at one definition of dominance do not necessarilly apply to other definitions. Existing definitions can be structural or functional, refer to roles or to agonistic behaviour, regard dominance as a property of individuals or as an attribute of dyadic encounters, concentrate on aggression or on the lack of it, and be based either on theoretical constructs or on observable behaviour. Thirteen definitions of dominance are reviewed, and their usefulness assessed with respect to their descriptive value. The predictive and explanatory values of definitions are specific to the questions asked in each particular study and are not considered as criteria to judge the usefulness of the dominance concept. By virtue of its high descriptive value, the original definition of dominance by SCHJELDERUPP-EBBE (1922, Z.Psychol. 88: 226-252) emerged as the basis to formulate a structural definition with wide applicability and which reflects the essence of the concept: Dominance is an attribute of the pattern of repeated, agonistic interactions between two individuals, characterized by a consistent outcome in favour of the same dyad member and a default yielding response of its opponent rather than escalation. The status of the consistent winner is dominant and that of the loser subordinate. Dominance status refers to dyads while dominance rank, high or low, refers to the position in a hierarchy and, thus, depends on group composition. Dominance is a relative measure and not an absolute property of individuals. The discussion includes reference to the heritability of dominance, application of dominance to groups rather than individuals, and the role of individual recognition and memory during agonistic encounters.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The social environment is a key feature influencing primate life histories. Chacma baboons (Papio hamadryas ursinus) are a female-bonded species with a strict linear dominance hierarchy. In this species, the allocation of energy to competing demands of growth and reproduction is hypothesized to vary as a function of competitive ability, which in turn increases with social rank. Since growth rate is a major component of life history models, measures of age-specific growth were used to analyze variation in life history traits across social ranks. Weights of 42 immature baboons were obtained without sedation or baiting from a troop of well-habituated chacma baboons in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Using demographic and weight data from this wild population, five main findings emerged: 1) Weight for age and growth rate of infant and juvenile females are positively associated with maternal rank. 2) Male  growth is not influenced by maternal rank. 3) Female growth shows smaller variation across feeding conditions than male  growth. 4) Low-ranking adult females continue investment in offspring through prolonged lactation until they reach a weight comparable to that of high-ranking infants. 5) The benefit of rank to reproductive success shown in this study is 0.83 additional offspring. Reproductive span determined predominantly by age at maturation contributes 27-38\% to the difference in expected number of offspring by rank, vs. 62-73\% due to reproductive rate. These findings have major implications for understanding the role of social environment in phenotypic plasticity of life history traits, and in the evolution of primate life histories.

	abstract = {1. 	In many Old World monkey species, reproductive benefits accrue to high-ranking males and females. During 15 months' observation of the agonistic interactions of free-ranging juvenile and subadult baboons, most individuals assumed ranks similar to those of their mothers during disputes with their peers. Maternal intervention in the disputes of their offspring appeared to be the primary factor affecting the inheritance of rank. Both the rate and the relative success of maternal aiding behavior were correlated with maternal rank, and therefore tended to perpetuate the existing rank heirarchy across generations.
2. 	Although the ranks of immature animals depended on the ability of family members to support them successfully when threatened, immature animals formed aggressive alliances primarily with the members of highranking matrilines. In contrast, adult females in the study troop formed alliances primarily with probably related individuals of adjacent rank. A model is presented that attempts to explain ontogenetic changes in alliance formation on the basis of the potential costs and benefits of entering into aggressive alliances with particular indivuduals.},

Explicit criteria for determining dominance in baboons are presented and the consistency of dominance relationships through time is analyzed for all classes of individuals. Related data on reproductive cycle length, perineal and behavioral indications of the optimal day for mating, changes in female behavior during estrus, and effects of the presence of estrous females on group organization are also included. This work constitutes the first comprehensive field study of baboon mating systems and social organization and emphasizes the use of systematic behavior sampling techniques in the field and quantitative models in the study of primate social behavior.},

Consequently, alpha male paternity certainty is high and underpins significant levels of infanticide by immigrant males that, in turn, has selected for male defense of infants. There is also, however, a high probability that alpha males will be absent during the period when their own offspring are vulnerable, suggesting selection for additional countermeasures. We use data from a long-term study to test the prediction that alpha male chacma baboons cede reproductive opportunities to subordinate males and that this leads to the presence of other fathers that can serve as a buffer against infanticidal attack. We found that subordinate males obtained significantly more conceptive opportunities than predicted by priority of access alone, and that this occurred because alpha males did not consort all receptive periods. There was no evidence that this was due to energetic constraint, large male cohorts, alpha male inexperience, or the competitive strength of queuing subordinates. The number of males who benefited from concession and the length of time that they were resident relative to those who did not benefit in this way greatly reduced the probability that infants of alpha males would face immigrant males without a surrogate father whose own offspring were vulnerable. The absence of such males was associated with observed infanticide as well as, unexpectedly, an increased likelihood of takeover when alpha males with vulnerable infants were present.},

Many of the diversified features of social behaviour and organization in this genus have been attributed to socio-ecological differences. However, some core aspects of social behaviour and organization appear to be highly conservative, suggesting a high degree of phylogenetic inertia. A recently derived classification of macaque social organization, as well as a large range of social and physical traits, were analysed for 16 species to ascertain the role of phylogeny in explaining the distribution of these traits within the genus Macaca. These traits were mapped onto two alternative phylogenies. The pattern of social organization, based on the degree of asymmetry in social relations, exhibited a high and significant level of phylogenetic inertia, as did seven of the 22 individual traits compared. A profile constructed of the most likely ancestral state for this character matrix showed that it most closely resembles the pattern present in the Barbary macaque (M. sylvanus), which, based on both molecular and morphological data, most closely resembles the ancestral macaque.},

	abstract = {An impressive body of research has focused on the mechanisms by which the steroid estrogens (E), progestins (P), and glucocorticoids (GC) ensure successful pregnancy. With the advance of non-invasive techniques to measure steroids in urine and feces, steroid hormones are routinely monitored to detect pregnancy in wild mammalian species, but hormone data on fetal loss have been sparse. Here, we examine fecal steroid hormones from five groups of wild yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus) in the Amboseli basin of Kenya to compare the hormones of successful pregnancies to those ending in fetal loss or stillbirth. Using a combination of longitudinal and cross-sectional data, we analyzed three steroid hormones (E, P, GC) and related metabolites from 5 years of fecal samples across 188 pregnancies. Our results document the course of steroid hormone concentrations across successful baboon pregnancy in the wild and demonstrate that fecal estrogens predicted impending fetal loss starting 2 months before the externally observed loss. By also considering an additional 450 pregnancies for which we did not have hormonal data, we determined that the probability for fetal loss for Amboseli baboons was 13.9\%, and that fetal mortality occurred throughout gestation (91 losses occurred in 656 pregnancies; rates were the same for pregnancies with and without hormonal data). These results demonstrate that our longstanding method for early detection of pregnancies based on observation of external indicators closely matches hormonal identification of pregnancy in wild baboons.

	abstract = {Environmental conditions are a key factor mediating reproductive success or failure. Consequently, many mammalian taxa have breeding seasons that coordinate critical reproductive stages with optimal environmental conditions. However, in contrast with most mammals, baboons (Papio cynocephalus) of Kenya reproduce throughout the year. Here we depart from the typical approach of evaluating seasonal effects on reproduction and engage in a more fine-grained analysis of the actual ecological conditions leading up to reproduction for females. Our aim was to determine how environmental conditions, in combination with social and demographic factors, might mediate baboon reproduction. The data set includes all female reproductive cycles from multiple baboon groups in the Amboseli basin between 1976 and 2004. Results indicate that after periods of drought or extreme heat, females were significantly less likely to cycle than expected. If females did cycle after these conditions, they were less likely to conceive; and if they did conceive after drought (heat effects were nonsignificant), they were less likely to have a successful pregnancy. Age also significantly predicted conceptive failure; conceptive probability was lowest among the youngest and oldest cycling females. There was also a trend for high ambient temperatures to contribute to fetal loss during the first trimester but not other trimesters. Finally, group size and drought conditions interacted in their effects on the probability of conception. Although females in all groups had equal conception probabilities during optimal conditions, females in large groups were less likely than those in small groups to conceive during periods of drought. These results indicate that in a highly variable environment, baboon reproductive success is mediated by the interaction between proximate ecological conditions and individual demographic factors.},

Since 1906 when its uterine-contracting properties were described until 50 years later when its sequence was elucidated, research has focused on its peripheral roles in reproduction. Only over the past several decades have researchers focused on what functions Oxt might have in the brain, the subject of this review. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei are the neurons of origin for the Oxt released from the posterior pituitary. Smaller cells in various parts of the brain, as well as release from magnocellular dendrites, provide the Oxt responsible for modulating various behaviors at its only identified receptor. Although Oxt is implicated in a variety of "non-social" behaviors, such as learning, anxiety, feeding and pain perception, it is Oxt's roles in various social behaviors that have come to the fore recently. Oxt is important for social memory and attachment, sexual and maternal behavior, and aggression. Recent work implicates Oxt in human bonding and trust as well. Human disorders characterized by aberrant social interactions, such as autism and schizophrenia, may also involve Oxt expression. Many, if not most, of Oxt's functions, from social interactions (affiliation, aggression) and sexual behavior to eventual parturition, lactation and maternal behavior, may be viewed as specifically facilitating species propagation.},

An intensive 19-month field study of mate choice and mate competition among savanna baboons was undertaken in order to elucidate those factors influencing mating success. During this study, male agonistic rank was not correlated with male mating success among adult males. However, the inclusion of adolescent males into the analysis yielded significant correlations between rank and mating success. Examination of prior fieldwork revealed that no baboon field study has conclusively demonstrated a significant correlation between male rank and reproduction among adult males. Most studies reporting a correlation between male rank and reproduction have included subadult males in the analysis. It is concluded that male rank is an unreliable predictor of male reproductive activity among adult male baboons. A low agonistic rank need not reduce male mating success because adult male baboons utilize a variety of reproductive tactics in gaining access to consort females.},

	abstract = {Temperament describes the idea that individual behavioural differences are repeatable over time and across situations. This common phenomenon covers numerous traits, such as aggressiveness, avoidance of novelty, willingness to take risks, exploration, and sociality. The study of temperament is central to animal psychology, behavioural genetics, pharmacology, and animal husbandry, but relatively few studies have examined the ecology and evolution of temperament traits. This situation is surprising, given that temperament is likely to exert an important influence on many aspects of animal ecology and evolution, and that individual variation in temperament appears to be pervasive amongst animal species. Possible explanations for this neglect of temperament include a perceived irrelevance, an insufficient understanding of the link between temperament traits and fitness, and a lack of coherence in terminology with similar traits often given different names, or different traits given the same name. We propose that temperament can and should be studied within an evolutionary ecology framework and provide a terminology that could be used as a working tool for ecological studies of temperament. Our terminology includes five major temperament trait categories: shyness-boldness, exploration-avoidance, activity, sociability and aggressiveness. This terminology does not make inferences regarding underlying dispositions or psychological processes, which may have restrained ecologists and evolutionary biologists from working on these traits. We present extensive literature reviews that demonstrate that temperament traits are heritable, and linked to fitness and to several other traits of importance to ecology and evolution. Furthermore, we describe ecologically relevant measurement methods and point to several ecological and evolutionary topics that would benefit from considering temperament, such as phenotypic plasticity, conservation biology, population sampling, and invasion biology.},

	abstract = {In group-living animals relative rank positions are often associated with differences in glucocorticoid output. During phases of social stability, when dominance positions are clear and unchallenged, subordinates often face higher costs in terms of social stress than dominant individuals. In this study we test this prediction and examine additional potential correlates of stress, such as reproductive season, age and amount of aggression received in wild, seasonally breeding Assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis). During a mating and a non-mating season we collected 394 It of focal observational data and 440 fecal samples of six adult and six large subadult males living in a multimale-multifemale group in their natural habitat in northeastern Thailand. The mating season was characterized by a general increase in aggressive behavior and glucocorticoid excretion across all males compared to the non-mating season. Among adult males, mating season glucocorticoid levels were significantly negatively related with dominance rank and positively with the amount of aggression received. Both relationships were non-significant among large subadult males. Thus, our results suggest that in adult Assamese macaques a high dominance position is not associated with high costs. Low costs of dominance might be induced by strong social bonds among top-ranking males, which exchange frequent affiliative interactions and serve as allies in coalitionary aggression against potentially rank-challenging subordinate males.

However, the dominance relationships among adult hamadryas males (Papio hamadryas) are poorly understood, and systematic data are missing from the literature. This study investigated dominance relationships among male hamadryas baboons by applying novel statistical techniques to systematic detailed data on agonistic interactions. We also analyzed the dominance relationship with male age and evaluated the association between dominance and access to mating partners (i.e. the number of adult females per one-male unit (OMU)), food resources (i.e. monopolization of feeding areas), and greeting interactions. The derived dominance indexes showed that, in general, leader males were dominant over followers, and that dominance ability did not correlate with male age. Individual dominance values were very close to each other, suggesting that dominance relationships among hamadryas males were not very rigid. In addition, dominance values were positively correlated with number of adult females per OMU but not with feeding priority. Finally, greeting interactions occurred more frequently between individuals with similar dominance values and with low levels of dominance decidedness. We suggest the need of further studies, especially in wild populations, to confirm our findings.},

	abstract = {The challenge hypothesis (J. C. Wingfield, R. E. Hegner, B. G. Ball, and A. M. Duffy, 1990, Am. Nat 136, 829-846) proposes that in birds, reptiles, and fish, "the frequency or intensity of reproductive aggression as an effect of T[estosterone] is strongest in situations of social instability, such as during the formation of dominance relationships, the establishment of territorial boundaries, or challenges by a conspecific male for a territory or access to mates" (p. 833). To determine the extension of this hypothesis to mammalian species, we tested predictions of the hypothesis in a nonpaternal, seasonal breeding, prosimian primate (ring-tailed lemurs, Lemur catta). Semi-free-ranging males were studied during periods of social stability (premating period) and instability (mating period). The annual mating season consists of several days during which males fight for access to promiscuous group females as each individually becomes sexually receptive for 1 day. Male rates of aggression were compared to fecal testosterone levels within premating and mating periods. In the premating period male rate of aggression was not significantly correlated with testosterone level. By contrast, during the mating season testosterone and aggression levels were positively and significantly correlated. However, on days just preceding estrus, male rate of aggression was not significantly correlated with testosterone, but on days of estrus, when aggressive challenges peaked sharply, testosterone and aggression were highly positively correlated. These results suggest that the challenge hypothesis applies to mammals as well as to birds, reptiles, and fish. In addition, elevations in testosterone were tightly circumscribed around days of estrus, suggesting a com-promise between costs and benefits of elevated testosterone levels.

	abstract = {Variation in the social environment is a fundamental component of many vertebrate societies. In humans and other primates, adverse social environments often translate into lasting physiological costs. The biological mechanisms associated with these effects are therefore of great interest, both for understanding the evolutionary impacts of social behavior and in the context of human health. However, large gaps remain in our understanding of the mechanisms that mediate these effects at the molecular level. Here we addressed these questions by leveraging the power of an experimental system that consisted of 10 social groups of female macaques, in which each individual's social status (i.e., dominance rank) could be experimentally controlled. Using this paradigm, we show that dominance rank results in a widespread, yet plastic, imprint on gene regulation, such that peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression data alone predict social status with 80\% accuracy. We investigated the mechanistic basis of these effects using cell type-specific gene expression profiling and glucocorticoid resistance assays, which together contributed to rank effects on gene expression levels for 694 (70\%) of the 987 rank-related genes. We also explored the possible contribution of DNA methylation levels to these effects, and identified global associations between dominance rank and methylation profiles that suggest epigenetic flexibility in response to status-related behavioral cues. Together, these results illuminate the importance of the molecular response to social conditions, particularly in the immune system, and demonstrate a key role for gene regulation in linking the social environment to individual physiology.},

In addition, quantitative genetics may not be as logistically difficult for threatened populations as was once thought. Finally, quantitative genetic models provide a better outlook for conservation programs than single-locus models.},

	abstract = {* It is widely recognized that macroecological patterns are not independent of the evolution of the lineages involved in generating these patterns. While many researchers have begun to evaluate the effect of ancestor–descendant relationships on observed patterns using the phylogenetic comparative method, most macroecological studies only utilize the cross-sectional comparative method to ‘remove the phylogenetic history’, without considering the option of evaluating its effect without removing it. * Currently, most researchers use this method without explicitly evaluating three fundamental evolutionary assumptions of the comparative method: (i) that the phylogeny is constructed without error (which implies evaluating phylogenetic uncertainty); (ii) that more closely related species tend to show more similar characters than expected by chance (which implies evaluating the phylogenetic signal) and; (iii) that the model of the characters' evolution effectively recapitulates their history (which implies comparing the fit of several evolutionary models and evaluating the uncertainty of the estimating model parameters). * Macroecological studies will benefit from the use of the comparative method to assess the effect of phylogenetic history without removing its effect. The comparative method will also allow for the simultaneous analysis of trait evolution and its impact on diversification rates; it is important to evaluate these processes together because they are not independent. In addition, explicit evaluations of the assumptions of comparative methods using Bayesian inferences will allow researchers to quantify the uncertainty of specific evolutionary hypotheses accounting for observed macroecological patterns. * We illustrate the usefulness of the method using the phylogeny of the genus Sebastes (Pisces: Scorpaeniformes), together with data on the body size–latitudinal range relationship to estimate the effect of phylogenetic history on the observed macroecological pattern.},

Here we provide evidence that social network tendencies are heritable in a gregarious primate. The tendency for rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, to be tied affiliatively to others via connections mediated by their social partners - analogous to friends of friends in people - demonstrated additive genetic variance. Affiliative tendencies were predicted by genetic variation at two loci involved in serotonergic signalling, although this result did not withstand correction for multiple tests. Aggressive tendencies were also heritable and were related to reproductive output, a fitness proxy. Our findings suggest that, like humans, the skills and temperaments that shape the formation of multi-agent relationships have a genetic basis in nonhuman primates, and, as such, begin to fill the gaps in our understanding of the genetic basis of sociality.},

In an attempt to remedy this logistical issue, we here investigate the use of ethanol as an alternative to freezing for the preservation of steroid and indoleamine hormones in avian plasma. Known quantities of the steroids 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), testosterone, 17β-estradiol, corticosterone, and the indoleamine melatonin were added to a stripped pool of chicken plasma. Samples were either immediately frozen at −40 °C, or treated with pure ethanol. Ethanol-treated samples were either immediately frozen, or—to simulate storage conditions at various field locations—left sitting at room temperature for one to two months, or incubated at 36 °C for one month before all treatment groups were frozen at −40 °C. All samples were then analyzed by radioimmunoassay. For DHT and estradiol there were no differences among treatment groups suggesting that ethanol-treatment is as effective as immediate freezing in preserving plasma steroid concentrations. For testosterone, corticosterone and melatonin ethanol-treated samples differed significantly from immediately frozen samples suggesting that caution is needed when comparing absolute concentrations of hormones between samples preserved in different ways. However, differences among ethanol-treated samples in general were small, demonstrating the feasibility of this preservation method in the field at remote locations.},

Techniques developed to collect and assay feces from free-ranging muriqui monkeys (Brachyteles arachnoides) for estradiol and progesterone yield the first explicit reproductive data on this species, and provide the first opportunity to evaluate the timing of observed copulations with muriqui ovarian cycles. Hormonal profiles from seven females indicate average cycle lengths of 21.0 ± 5.4 days (n=20). Females conceived after 3–6 ovulatory cycles. Gestation length averaged 216.4 ± 1.5 days for the five females for which conception cycles were sampled. Discrete copulation periods spanned an average of 2.1 ± 1.2 days (n=29), with intervals between these concentrated periods of copulations averaging 15.6 ± 6.7 days (n=20). There were no significant differences among females in cycle lengths, copulation period lengths, or copulation interval lengths. Ejaculation was visible following 71.8 ± 26.7\% of copulations during the females' preovulatory periods. All females copulated outside the periovulatory period. The proportion of copulation days outside the periovulatory period was slightly greater (p=0.08) for primiparous females (64.8 ± 28.3\%) than for multiparous females (28.7 ± 19.7\%). Am. J.

	abstract = {Young male baboons typically disperse from their group of birth as they near adult size and may continue to migrate between social groups throughout their lives. Long-term data on dispersal and residence patterns of male baboons in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, were available for 110 males in the population, including 43 that were monitored during their natal dispersal. These data enabled us to provide not only a detailed evaluation of the effects of reproductive competition on dispersal but also the first direct estimates of the costs of dispersal in male primates and one of the few direct estimates of fitness costs associated with breeding in the natal group. Males underwent natal dispersal at a median age of 8.5 yr (range, 6.8-13.4 yr) and subsequently remained in nonnatal groups for a median tenure of 24 mo (range, 1-138 mo). Half of the males in the study engaged in moderate to extensive reproductive activity before natal dispersal. Reproductive costs associated with breeding in the natal group were suggested by the high mortality of offspring for whom natal males were their likely fathers, even though maternal relatives avoided mating with each other. Dispersal involved considerable time spent alone, and therefore the costs of dispersal were substantial, because of mortality risks and missed reproductive opportunities during dispersal. Female availability and male mating success apparently affected both natal and secondary dispersal patterns. We present a model of dispersal tendency in order to explicate the ways in which differences in population density, predation risk, and the distribution of mating opportunities among groups might result in complex dispersal patterns that are consistent with both the results of the present study and the disparate empirical reports in the literature.},

	abstract = {Unlike most cercopithecines, hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas hamadryas) are characterized by female-biased dispersal. To clarify this pattern within the context of their hierarchical social system (comprising one-male units, clans, bands, and troops), we report here 7 years of data on female transfers among social units in wild hamadryas baboons in Ethiopia. Female tenure in one-male units (OMUs) ranged from 1 to 2,556 days (N = 208) and survival analysis revealed a median tenure length of 1,217 days (40 months). Changes in OMU membership consisted almost exclusively of takeovers by males, not voluntary transfer. Of 130 takeovers, 67\% occurred within the band and 33\% across bands, and, of the 22 takeovers for which we have clan membership data, 77\% occurred within, not between, clans. These results reinforce the notion that hamadryas female dispersal is not analogous to sex-biased dispersal in other taxa, because (1) at least in Ethiopian populations, females do not disperse voluntarily but are transferred, often forcibly, by males; (2) only dispersal between bands will promote gene flow, whereas females are most often rearranged within bands; (3) hamadryas females undergo social dispersal but not usually locational dispersal; and (4) while male hamadryas are far more philopatric than females, they have been observed to disperse. It thus appears that the ancestral baboon pattern of female philopatry and male dispersal has evolved into a system in which neither sex is motivated to disperse, but females are forcibly transferred by males, leading to female-mediated gene flow, and males more rarely disperse to find females.

	abstract = {Baboons (Papio, s.s.) comprise a series of parapatric allotaxa (subspecies or closely related species) widely distributed in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite extensive studies of their ecology, morphology, and behavior, disagreement about their phylogenetic relationships continues, as expressed in the current coexistence of at least three major, competing taxonomic treatments. To help resolve this situation, we sequenced ∼900 bases of mitochondrial DNA of 40 individuals from five of the widely recognized “major” allotaxa. Total sequence diversity ({\textgreater}5\%) is high compared to most primate species. Major mitochondrial clades correspond to recognized allotaxa, with the important exception that haplotypes from yellow and olive baboons form a single, monophyletic clade within which the two allotaxa do not comprise mutually exclusive clusters. The major clades fall unambiguously into the pattern: (chacma (Guinea (hamadryas (yellow + olive)))). This phylogeny does not support taxonomies that oppose hamadryas to all other baboons (“desert” vs. “savanna”), but is compatible with the view that all definable allotaxa should be recognized as coordinates, either as “phylogenetic” species or “biological” subspecies. The close relationship and unsegregated distribution of haplotypes from Kenyan and Tanzanian yellow and olive baboons are unexplained, but may reflect introgression across the documented hybrid zone. The overall phylogeny, when combined with paleontological data, suggests a southern African origin for extant Papio baboons, with all extant lineages sharing a common mitochondrial ancestor at approximately 1.8 Ma.

	abstract = {Elucidating the information content of vocal signals is fundamental to the understanding of animal communication. Acoustically distinct calls produced in specific contexts allow listeners to predict future events and choose adequate responses. However, the vocal repertoires of most terrestrial mammals consist of a limited number of call types that vary within and between categories. These “graded signaling systems” are thought to be rich in information, at the cost of increasing uncertainty regarding call categorization. In this study, patterns of acoustic variation in grunts of wild chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) were assessed in relation to different contexts, callers’ arousal, the presence of listeners, and individual identity. Although overall production specificity was low, and sensitive to the number of contexts under consideration, grunts given in three contexts could be statistically distinguished from each other. Contextual differences remained when controlling for caller arousal, suggesting that these differences cannot be explained by variation in arousal. No audience effect was detected, but individual identity was found to have an influence on acoustic structure. Overall, these results support the view that, in comparison to other signaling systems associated with hazardous conditions, lower production specificity might evolve under relaxed circumstances where unambiguous signaling is less important.},

Attainment of alpha rank by immigrants is a qualitatively different process from thestepwise increase in status noted in linear dominance hierarchies. The departing rank of natal emigrants was 5.4, while the first measured rank, shortly after transfer into a new troop, was 1.5. Abrupt rises to alpha rank involve direct challenges to the current alpha male. Fourteen of 19 prime immigrants attained alpha rank at first transfer. Rank rises may result if individuals forego contests, retaining lower hierarchical positions in their natal troop to avoid the costs of conflict prior to natal emigration. In this population some males do breed in their natal troops without differing from immigrants in their reprodocutive success. Five males that rose to high rank within their natal troops also made rapid rank rises to the top of the hierarchy. Withholding of aggressive efforts in natal troops to avoid inbreeding thus is not an adequate explanation of the rank rises we observe in this population. The high probability of successful challenges can be explained by assuming an asymmetry in costs of losing (resource value) to tenured alpha males or a greater fighting ability of challengers.},

Longitudinal and cross-sectional data on weight and age in three troops that lived under a variety of ecological circumstances showed a good fit to the von Bertalanffy growth equation. Male and female baboons have different growth constants (K) and different asymptotic weights and ages resulting in the observed baboon sexual dimorphism. Within sexes, growth constants and asymptotic weights varied between troops in the same year and for the same troop in different years. Improvements in nutrition increased growth rate and final weight and decreased age at asymptote in both naturally foraging and in food-enhanced wild groups. Testes and cape length follow the same growth pattern and have the same asymptotic age as body mass among naturally foraging males. Canine growth is different with full size achieved nearly 2 years earlier. Toothwear is an accurate relative age indicator for immature and adult females and for immature males but not for adult males because of the role that large canines play in occlusion and wear. The data suggest that creating a dichotomy between captive and wild primates is overly simplistic since conditions for growth in the wild can overlap those of captivity, not just for food enhanced individuals but also among naturally foraging troops. The nutritional perspective on primate growth exposes inherent problems in our present system of primate age classification which have serious implications for the use of age classes in behavioral analyses.},

	abstract = {The frequencies and types of adult male aggressive behavior of confined Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata)and free-ranging olive baboons (Papio anubis)were compared. The baboons, which do not have a mating season, were more aggressive to conspecific males than were the macaques during their nonmating season. The baboons also solicited aid during aggressive encounters more frequently than the macaques. However, during their mating season, the macaques were more aggressive to conspecific females than were the baboons. The macaques were also involved in more triadic sequences of aggression, and the frequency of occurrence of these patterns supported Chase’s theory of dominance hierarchy formation and maintenance. The differences in aggressive behavior appeared to be related to the seasonal reproductive cycle of the macaques.},

Relative rank between juvenile male was dependent on size/age, but relative rank between juvenile males and adult females was dependent on mother's rank. Juvenile females ranked according to their mother's rank both with same-sex peers and with adult females. Correlations between individual rank in these hierarchies and rates of supplanting interactions and proximity to others were examined to assess possible competitive advantage. Solicitations and supportive behaviour between kin were assessed as possible mechanisms for transmission of maternal rank. The functional consequences of these different hierarchies were discussed.},

	abstract = {To date, it is not known whether the seasonal occurrence of sexual behavior and mating in free-ranging Hanuman langurs at Ramnagar, Nepal, is correlated with seasonal changes in female ovarian function, and, if so, which factor(s) triggers the onset of the reproductive period. Using non-invasive fecal hormone analysis in combination with behavioral observations, this study was carried out to: 1) investigate and characterize seasonal patterns of ovarian cyclicity and timing of conception in wild langur females living in a highly seasonal habitat; and 2) examine the relationship between seasonal patterns of ovarian cyclicity, behavioral estrus, and female physical condition. Behavioral data and fecal samples were collected during a total period of 14 months from nine females living in a multi-male group. Physical condition of the females was assessed monthly by visual inspection, using a seven-fold scale. Ovulatory cycles and timing of conceptions were identified by the measurement of immunoreactive pregnanediol glucuronide (iPdG) in extracted feces. Hormone profiles in individual females revealed a clearly seasonal distribution in the occurrence of ovulatory cycles, which were restricted to the period from July to October. The distribution of female estrus behavior showed a similar seasonal pattern, and in total 88.2\% of all estrus periods observed in the focal females were accompanied by ovulation. Onset of ovarian cycles as well as mating activities were strongly correlated with the onset of the rainy season. Females conceived, on average, in their second ovulatory cycle (pregnancy length: 211.6 ± 3.4 days), with timing of conception being confined to the months when animals showed an improved physical condition. Collectively the present data clearly suggest that in seasonally-breeding langurs at Ramnagar, ecological conditions (rainfall, food availability, and quality) influence the onset of ovulations and timing of conceptions.

	abstract = {Since the pioneering paper "Measurement of Excreted Steroids in Macaca nemestrina" [Risler et al., American Journal of Primatology 12:91-100, 1987] was first published, field primatologists have been using fecal extraction techniques to examine adrenal and gonadal hormones. These techniques have allowed investigators to determine reproductive conditions in wild primates without causing any disruption to the populations. Over the years, many techniques have been developed to improve the ease of analysis, transportation, and purification. More of the processing can now be done in the field. This paper describes the methodology developed or adapted at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, and the factors involved in preparing fecal samples for steroid analysis. We provide information on the steps involved in extracting and purifying steroids from feces for measurement. The latest methods include field processing of samples, such as drying collected material or separating steroids from the fecal material by solid phase extraction (SPE). How samples are processed in the field determines the requirements for international transportation and the methods used in the laboratory. The pros and cons of the different processing methods are discussed. We also report on recent advances in laboratory quantification, with implications for steroid isolation prior to analysis. The different processes involved in isolating and measuring fecal steroids discussed here will enable investigators to understand the components necessary to ensure accurate and reliable results.},

Presenting a broad continuum of levels of analysis, from molecular to evolutionary, the book discusses how genes work, the structure of cells, the interactions of endocrine organs, the behavior of individuals, the structure of social hierarchies, and the evolution of mating systems.  The second edition, while maintaining the strengths of the first edition, has been thoroughly revised to reflect recent developments in genetics and molecular biology and related social concerns. It contains four new chapters: on the use of molecular biology techniques in behavioral endocrinology, on psychoneuroimmunology, on hormonal influences on sensorimotor function, and on cognitive function in nonhuman animals.},

Its focus is on the physiology of human reproduction and evidence of adaptation, and hence the action of natural selection, in that domain. But at the same time the study of human reproductive ecology provides an important perspective on the historical process of human evolution, a lens through which we may view the forces that have shaped us as a species. In the end, all actions of natural selection can be reduced to variation in the reproductive success of individuals. Peter Ellison is one of the pioneers in the fast growing area of reproductive ecology. He has collected for this volume the research of thirty-one of the most active and influential scientists in the field. Thanks to recent noninvasive techniques, these contributors can present direct empirical data on the effect of a broad array of ecological, behavioral, and constitutional variables on the reproductive processes of humans as well as wild primates. Because biological evolution is cumulative, however, organisms in the present must be viewed as products of the selective forces of past environments. The study of adaptation thus often involves inferences about formative ecological relationships that may no longer exist, or not in the same form. Making such inferences depends on carefully weighing a broad range of evidence drawn from studies of contemporary ecological variation, comparative studies of related taxonomies, and paleontological and genetic evidence of evolutionary history. The result of this inquiry sheds light not only on the functional aspects of an organism's contemporary biology but also on its evolutionary history and the selective forces that have shaped it through time.

	abstract = {Year–round association between adult males and females is common in primates, even though internal gestation and lactation predispose males to mate–desertion in the majority of mammals. Because there is little a priori support for alternative explanations, we hypothesized that permanent male–female association in primates serves to reduce the risk of infanticide by strange males whenever females and infants are closely associated. For a phylogenetic test of this hypothesis, we reconstructed the evolution of male–female and female–infant association among primates. The results of Maddison's concentrated changes test confirmed the prediction that mother–infant association, as opposed to infant parking, and female–male association did not evolve independently. Changes in litter size and activity, in contrast, were not significantly associated with evolutionary changes in male–female association. Thus, we demonstrate a fundamental link between primate life history and social behaviour, explain the most basic type of variation in primate social organization, and propose an additional determinant of social organization that may also operate in other mammals.},

This review follows the trail of research on oxytocin and vasopressin as an exemplar of one path for exploring the “dark matter” of social neuroscience. Studies across vertebrate species suggest that these neuropeptides are important for social cognition, with gender- and steroid-dependent effects. Comparative research in voles yields a model based on interspecies and intraspecies variation of the geography of oxytocin receptors and vasopressin V1a receptors in the forebrain. Highly affiliative species have receptors in brain circuits related to reward or reinforcement. The neuroanatomical distribution of these receptors may be guided by variations in the regulatory regions of their respective genes. This review describes the promises and problems of extrapolating these findings to human social cognition, with specific reference to the social deficits of autism.},

In this chapter, we use a sample of yellow baboons captured in the Mikumi National Park, Tanzania, and Guinea baboons living in a captive colony to test the prediction that they will resemble olive and hamadryas baboons respectively, in relative, adult testicular size. Like olives, yellow baboons develop large testes in a late growth spurt, while Guineas, like hamadryas, do not. Yellow baboons apparently have relatively smaller testes than olives at all ages, but this effect is probably an artifact of their long-limbed body build and disappears if a measure of trunk volume (rather than total body mass) is used as a proxy of functional body size. Previous work also showed a difference between olive and hamadryas baboons in juvenile testicular ontogeny, explicable in terms of dispersal rather than adult testicular size. Male hamadryas, which breed in their natal group, undergo testicular enlargement earlier than olives, perhaps reflecting general sexual precocity and/or opportunities to sneak copulations while “following” an OMU. Olive and yellow baboons, which have few mating opportunities before dispersal, have less developed testes as juveniles. Yellow baboons seem to be more extreme than olives in this respect, perhaps reflecting a lower propensity to disperse as juveniles, and thus fewer preadult mating opportunities. The few available data suggest that Guineas tend to resemble hamadryas in testicular ontogeny.},

	abstract = {Here, we review comparative studies of African mole-rats (family Bathyergidae) to explain how constraints acting at the ultimate (environmental) and proximate (organismal) levels have led to convergent gains and losses of sociality within this extensive adaptive radiation of subterranean rodents endemic to sub-Saharan Africa. At the ultimate level, living in environments that range from mesic through to arid has led to both variation and flexibility in social organization among species, culminating in the pinnacle of social evolution in the eusocial naked and Damaraland mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber and Fukomys damarensis). The common mole-rat (Cryptomys hottentotus) provides a model example of how plasticity in social traits exists within a single species inhabiting areas with different ecological constraint. At the proximate level, reproductive strategies and cooperative breeding may be constrained by the correlated evolution of a suite of traits including physiological suppression of reproduction, the development of physiological and morphological castes, and the mode of ovulatory control and seasonality in breeding. Furthermore, recent neurobiological advances indicate that differential patterns of neurotransmitter expression within the forebrain may underpin (and limit) either a solitary or group living/cooperative lifestyle not only in mole-rats, but also more widely among disparate mammalian taxa.},

This ongoing commitment to pesticides, Mark Winston argues, reflects our sense of place in nature: embattled, beleaguered, driven to aggression. His book, as sensible as it is wise, seeks to change this mindset, to show how a more measured and discriminating approach to pests, one based on management rather than eradication, might serve us and the natural world far better than our ill-fated all-out war." "Winston backs up this approach with a full battery of case studies that take us from lawns and kitchens to farms and orchards, from insects and weeds to rats and coyotes." "A compelling book about ethics and choices, Nature Wars shows us the difference between protecting ourselves from real pests and poisoning ourselves and the planet."--BOOK JACKET.},

	abstract = {The spatiotemporal distribution of females is thought to drive variation in mating systems, and hence plays a central role in understanding animal behavior, ecology and evolution. Previous research has focused on investigating the links between female spatiotemporal distribution and the number of males in haplorhine primates. However, important questions remain concerning the importance of spatial cohesion, the generality of the pattern across haplorhine and strepsirrhine primates, and the consistency of previous findings given phylogenetic uncertainty. To address these issues, we examined how the spatiotemporal distribution of females influences the number of males in primate groups using an expanded comparative dataset and recent advances in Bayesian phylogenetic and statistical methods. Specifically, we investigated the effect of female distributional factors (female number, spatial cohesion, estrous synchrony, breeding season duration and breeding seasonality) on the number of males in primate groups. Using Bayesian approaches to control for uncertainty in phylogeny and the model of trait evolution, we found that the number of females exerted a strong influence on the number of males in primate groups. In a multiple regression model that controlled for female number, we found support for temporal effects, particularly involving female estrous synchrony: the number of males increases when females are more synchronously receptive. Similarly, the number of males increases in species with shorter birth seasons, suggesting that greater breeding seasonality makes defense of females more difficult for male primates. When comparing primate suborders, we found only weak evidence for differences in traits between haplorhines and strepsirrhines, and including suborder in the statistical models did not affect our conclusions or give compelling evidence for different effects in haplorhines and strepsirrhines. Collectively, these results demonstrate that male monopolization is driven primarily by the number of females in groups, and secondarily by synchrony of female reproduction within groups.},

	doi = {10.1163/1568539X-00003089},
	abstract = {Male Colobus vellerosus compete intensely for access to females, which sometimes leads to mortal wounding. Yet, males often form cooperative relationships to overtake prime-aged males and immigrate into bisexual groups. We investigated the factors that predicted the presence of coalitions and affiliative relationships among males in this species. Interactions among males in 292 dyads from six groups were examined from 2004 to 2010 at Boabeng-Fiema, Ghana. Affiliation rates among males were higher and aggression rates lower when one or both males in the dyad were subadult, compared to adult male dyads. Affiliation rates tended to be higher among males that were kin but no other aspect of male relationships predicted affiliation. Coalitions among males were rarely observed and primarily occurred in the context of joint defense against extra-group males (93.5\% of events). Adult males were more likely to provide coalitionary support than subadults and coalitions occurred significantly more often when both males were high ranking, since these males probably benefited most in terms of reproductive success from excluding extra-group males. Rank-changing and leveling coalitions among low-ranking males appear to be quite rare or absent in C. vellerosus. The costs of these types of coalitions may be too high or male group size too small on average for these types of coalitions to have been selected for. The overall low rates of affiliation and coalitions among male C. vellerosus are likely influenced by male-biased dispersal and the high level of male–male competition.},

	abstract = {Researchers are increasingly documenting the existence of social tolerance and affiliative behavior among primate males, including in male-dispersing species. We investigated the nature of male social relationships in a relatively understudied macaque species, the moor macaque (Macaca maura), in order to expand our knowledge of male social relationships in male dispersing primates. The classification of social styles for primates rests largely on data about female social relationships. Therefore, by providing data on male–male relationships, we also contribute to our understanding of social style variation within the genus Macaca. Observations were conducted on a wild yet well-habituated group in Bantimurung-Bulusaraung National Park in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. We collected focal animal and ad libitum data on four adult males, recording social behavior during 209 contact hours over two field seasons in 2010 and 2011. The adult male moor macaques in this study did not interact frequently. Interactions that did occur more frequently involved affiliation rather than aggression, with greetings being the most common form of interaction. Greetings occurred in a predominately neutral context and were more common between specific males with uncertain or ambiguous dominance relationships and low-quality relationships, but the initiation of greetings was not linked to dominance rank. These results suggest that greetings enable males to communicate information about their willingness to invest in the relationship, representing one way for adult males to ease social tension and build social bonds. To expand our understanding of social style variation in Macaca, we compared our data to those published for other macaque taxa. In the present study, the observed pattern of aggression (i.e., low rate, low to moderate intensity and high symmetry) was consistent with the species’ social style classification as highly tolerant. The relatively low grooming rate and low percentage of counteraggression, however, were more consistent with the social style of less tolerant taxa. Further research is needed to determine what factors explain this pattern of social tolerance among male moor macaques.},

We examined the interaction of male sexual behavior with group composition and within-group mating pattern in a population of siamangs (Symphalangus syndactylus) containing unimale–unifemale groups and multimale–unifemale groups using mixed models. Aggression in a sexual context was never observed. As predicted, however, copulation rates were lower and copulations were significantly shorter in duration in two-male groups than in unimale groups, even if copulations involving subordinate males were excluded. Dominant males monopolized copulations with the group female in most groups, but copulations were shared among males in three stable two-male groups. When both resident males copulated with the group’s female, there was no evidence that copulating pairs moved to secluded areas, and the duration of copulations did not differ between males. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that male–male tolerance in multimale siamang groups is facilitated by adjustments to sexual behavior in the presence of a sexual competitor.},

	abstract = {In group living animals, there is pronounced variation in the formation and function of cooperation between males via coalitionary aggression. Pandit, van Schaik and colleagues developed a mathematical model to predict the evolution of different coalition types in group-living male primates, the PvS model. Coalitions are classified into five types dependent on the ranks of the participants and the function of the aggression. The main factor determining the coalition types expected to evolve is contest potential, an estimate of female monopolisability by individual males. We examined the model using groups of Assamese (Macaca assamensis) and Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus) to gain a full range of contest potentials. We observed, across groups, 393 coalitions during 3645 h of data collection. We measured contest potential on a species-specific basis dependent on the information males can infer about female reproductive state. By examining coalition formation in different populations and species, but also in the same groups over time, we showed the strengths and weaknesses of the PvS model. We discuss why our results do not fully fit the model’s predictions, including differing costs/benefits of coalition formation, such as delayed benefits via increased status, making rank-changing coalitions viable at mid–low contest potential. Alternative factors not considered by the model include the effect of male social bonds on coalition partner choice and the effect of female mate-choice on coalition target selection. Finally, we suggest possible improvements to the model and provide information on how best to test the current predictions of the PvS model.},

White-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) are unusual in that immigrant males form cooperative alliances with co-resident males during intergroup encounters, and also have affiliative and tolerant intragroup relationships. We collected approx. 3341 h of focal animal data on 25 adult and subadult males in five groups of wild Cebus capucinus in the Santa Rosa Sector, Costa Rica, across three distinct field seasons. Using generalized linear mixed models, we examined the influence of number of co-resident males, group socionomic sex ratio, dominance status and age, and past parallel dispersal on social bond strength (i.e., proximity, contact rest, grooming, preferred grooming partners) and quality (i.e., grooming reciprocity) for 47 unique male–male dyads. Overall, dyads that included an alpha male had the weakest and least equitable bonds, while dyads composed of subordinate males had the strongest and most equitable bonds, with subordinate subadult peers being most likely to form preferred relationships. Several measures of bond strength and quality were highest among dyads in groups with few males and low socionomic sex (female-to-male) ratios. Dyad partners who had previously engaged in parallel dispersal had slightly better bonds than those that did not, suggesting that kinship and/or familiarity may be important. Our results indicate that within groups, male relationships are influenced by power asymmetry, partner availability, and dyad relationship history.},

	abstract = {Cooperative relationships among male primates are emerging as an important aspect of primate social behavior. What remains unclear is the extent to which male associations with coresident males vary within species, and what social and demographic factors drive these associations. This information provides an important contribution to our understanding of how cooperative relationships play an adaptive role in the evolution of male social and reproductive strategies. To examine the nature of male associations and the influence of social and demographic factors, including rank and age, we collected 1751 h of focal behavioral data on adult males in two large multimale–multifemale groups of mantled howlers (Alouatta palliata) at La Pacifica, Costa Rica. Both groups inhabited upland forest area, were of similar size and sex ratio, and exhibited strongly linear male hierarchies. Based on observed spatial associations within 3 m proximity, dyadic patterns varied from strongly preferred to strongly avoided associations that were largely consistent among dyads over the study period. In contrast to reports from other mantled howler study sites, neither rank nor age differences among males predicted whether dyads spent any time in proximity to one another, nor the amount of time in proximity. However, higher-ranked males within dyads were more likely to maintain close proximity than their lower-ranked counterparts. Our results provide important data on the nature of male associations within mantled howler groups with linear dominance relationships, and are suggestive of the adaptive value of cooperative relationships.},

We analyzed a variety of social and environmental variables to determine which ones best explain the observed variation in interbirth intervals across 14 baboon populations. Both the number of females in the group and mean annual temperature were found to be important, and a multivariate equation containing the quadratic components of both these variables accounts for almost all the observed variance in interbirth intervals. The quadratic relationship with temperature is explained in terms of the energetic costs of maintaining a stable body temperature at both low and high temperatures. The quadratic relationship with number of females results from relationships with both food availability and the costs of increasing intragroup competition as group size increases. Although females may be able to exert a certain degree of choice in their reproductive scheduling decisions, they are ultimately constrained by limits imposed upon them by the complex interactions between their ecological and demographic environment.},

	abstract = {An optimization analysis of human behavior from a comparative perspective can improve our understanding of the adaptiveness of human nature. Intra-specific competition for resources provides the main selective pressure for the evolution of violent aggression toward conspecifics, and variation in the fitness benefits and costs of aggression can account for inter-specific and inter-individual differences in aggressiveness. When aggression reflects competition for resources, its benefits vary in relation to the characteristics of the resources (their intrinsic value, abundance, spatial distribution, and controllability) while its costs vary in relation to the characteristics of organisms and how they fight (which, in turn, affects the extent to which aggression entails risk of physical injury or death, energetic depletion, exposure to predation, psychological and physiological stress, or damage to social relationships). Humans are a highly aggressive species in comparison to other animals, probably as a result of an unusually high benefit-to-cost ratio for intra-specific aggression. This conclusion is supported by frequent and widespread occurrence of male-male coalitionary killing and by male-female sexual coercion. Sex differences in violent aggression in humans and other species probably evolved by sexual selection and reflect different optimal competitive strategies for males and females.},

	abstract = {During male takeovers, in addition to fighting off the female’s current mating partner, males may exhibit intense aggressive mate guarding of the newly acquired females. Recent studies indicate that coercive sexual aggression by males is an important strategy through which sexual conflict is expressed. Previous tests of the sexual coercion hypothesis in primates have focused on assessing if female mate choice is effectively reduced by male aggression, however, only one recent study has tested a critical prediction of this hypothesis, namely, that male coercion is reproductively costly to victim females. The present study uses 15 years of data on inter-birth intervals from a large multilevel colony of baboons, mostly Papio h. hamadryas, with a mating system based on harem-defence polygyny to examine if male takeovers impact the length of the abducted females’ inter-birth intervals. Our analysis of 121 inter-birth intervals from 45 adult females indicates that male takeovers are reproductively costly to abducted females as they are associated with an increase in the time they take to conceive and a lengthening of the inter-birth intervals. We discuss how several factors may contribute to this reproductive cost, including male-female sexual conflict, male-male competition, and female-female competition. Our findings suggest that the male’s aggressive herding is the main contributor to the abducted females’ immediate reproductive cost. We argue that although some of the male’s aggressive herding may be driven by male-male competition, nonetheless, it serves a coercive function as it both constrains the female’s mate choice options and hampers her immediate breeding performance. This conclusion is backed up by results obtained in the only other study that has tested the same prediction and which has been carried out in a wild population of hamadryas baboons.},

Here, we investigate the influence of kinship on the cooperative behavior of male chimpanzees living in an unusually large community at Ngogo in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Using long-term field observations and molecular genetic techniques to identify kin relations between individuals, we show that male chimpanzees clearly prefer to affiliate and cooperate with their maternal brothers in several behavioral contexts. Despite these results, additional analyses reveal that the impact of kinship is limited; paternal brothers do not selectively affiliate and cooperate, probably because they cannot be reliably recognized, and the majority of highly affiliative and cooperative dyads are actually unrelated or distantly related. These findings add to a growing body of research that indicates that animals cooperate with each other to obtain both direct and indirect fitness benefits and that complex cooperation can occur between kin and nonkin alike.},

	abstract = {The sexual, social, and agonistic behaviour-patterns of the Chacma baboon, P. ursinus, were the subject of field study chiefly in the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve where intensive close-range observation of a single group was possible. The mating system in this group was one in which the male dominant in terms of such criteria as frequency of aggressiveness and of social “attractiveness” (as shown by the number of animals presenting to him, and participating in grooming with him) tended to have a brief, exclusive relationship, with the female in full ocstrus. Other males would also mate with her, on the same day as the dominant male, before the stage of exclusion was reached. Data are presented on the frequency of occurrence of components of sexual behaviour. Presenting, grooming, mounting, and mating all tend to occur most frequently in the early part of the day. Social gestures, other than presenting and mounting, include a variety of greetings behaviour-patterns which occurred repeatedly between a tame young male baboon released near the group and the young males and females of this group. Agonistic behaviour was analysed particularly in terms of frequency and intensity of occurrence within the group. Aggressive opisodes by the dominant male occurred, on average, about once in six hours of day-time, except on the first occasion when the tame baboon accompanied the group on the whole of its day-range. The dominant male was then repeatedly aggressive throughout the day. A high positive correlation was found between the frequency of mating per day by the dominant male and the frequency of aggression by females against females. Analysis suggests that the peak of mating in the dominant male results in a proportional increase in tension amongst the females which is directed partly at the oestrous female, partly at other females. Aggressive episodes, sometimes very noisy and rough-looking, never resulted in visible injury to the victim, and mostly consisted of threats without physical contact. Supposed conflict-expressions, such as yawning, are briefly described. Further progress in such field studies may come chiefly from systematic quantification of results, obtained at close range on identifiable individuals and from experimental variations of the social situation such as the introduction of strange baboons on two occasions described in the present paper.},

	abstract = {Nonhuman primates use greeting behaviors as nonaggressive communicatory signals in multiple social contexts. Adult male mantled howlers (Alouatta palliata) perform a ritual greeting that has been associated with bond-strengthening functions. The aim of this study is to explore the greeting patterns of male howlers living on Agaltepec Island, Mexico. Specifically, we analyzed the relationships between greetings and several individual, relational, and contextual variables, such as the expression of affiliation and agonism, dominance rank, age, kinship relationships, spatial organization, activity patterns, and subgrouping patterns. Greetings were more frequent between males with closer dominance ranks. Among those dyads that greeted at least once, dominant males initiated greetings more frequently than less-dominant males. On the other hand, more greetings were observed when one of the participants had recently returned to a subgroup and during locomotion. On the basis of these results, we propose that on Agaltepec greetings are a conflict management mechanism used between males of similar ranks. The fission–fusion social system of this group of howlers allows males with conflicting interests to remain separated, and greetings may reduce tension during fusion events. Am. J.

Here, we use cross-species comparisons to investigate the correlates of breeding lifespan in male mammals. Our results show that male breeding lifespan depends on the extent of polygyny, which reflects the relative intensity of competition for access to females. Males have relatively short breeding tenure in species where individuals have the potential to monopolize mating with multiple females, and longer ones where individuals defend one female at a time. Male breeding tenure is also shorter in species in which females breed frequently than in those where females breed less frequently, suggesting that the costs of guarding females may contribute to limiting tenure length. As a consequence of these relationships, estimates of skew in male breeding success within seasons overestimate skew calculated across the lifetime and, in several polygynous species, variance in lifetime breeding success is not substantially higher in males than in females.},

But in the twenty-five years since its publication, new theories and research techniques for studying the Primate order have been developed, debated, and tested, forcing scientists to revise their understanding of our closest living relatives.Intended as a sequel to Primate Societies, The Evolution of Primate Societies compiles thirty-one chapters that review the current state of knowledge regarding the behavior of nonhuman primates. Chapters are written by the leading authorities in the field and organized around four major adaptive problems primates face as they strive to grow, maintain themselves, and reproduce in the wild. The inclusion of chapters on the behavior of humans at the end of each major section represents one particularly novel aspect of the book, and it will remind readers what we can learn about ourselves through research on nonhuman primates. The final section highlights some of the innovative and cutting-edge research designed to reveal the similarities and differences between nonhuman and human primate cognition. The Evolution of Primate Societies will be every bit the landmark publication its predecessor has been.},

We propose that infectious diseases are a significant cost associated with cultural transmission. We investigated two hypotheses that may explain such a connection: that social learning and exploratory behaviours (specifically, innovation and extractive foraging) either compensate for existing infection or increase exposure to infectious agents. We used Bayesian comparative methods, controlling for sampling effort, body mass, group size, geographical range size, terrestriality, latitude and phylogenetic uncertainty. Across 127 primate species, we found a positive association between pathogen richness and rates of innovation, extractive foraging and social learning. This relationship was driven by two independent phenomena: socially contagious diseases were positively associated with rates of social learning, and environmentally transmitted diseases were positively associated with rates of exploration. Because higher pathogen burdens can contribute to morbidity and mortality, we propose that parasitism is a significant cost associated with the behavioural patterns that underpin culture, and that increased pathogen exposure is likely to have played an important role in the evolution of culture in both non-human primates and humans.},

	abstract = {El Niño events are a prominent feature of climate variability with global climatic impacts. The 1997/98 episode, often referred to as ‘the climate event of the twentieth century’, and the 1982/83 extreme El Niño, featured a pronounced eastward extension of the west Pacific warm pool and development of atmospheric convection, and hence a huge rainfall increase, in the usually cold and dry equatorial eastern Pacific. Such a massive reorganization of atmospheric convection, which we define as an extreme El Niño, severely disrupted global weather patterns, affecting ecosystems, agriculture, tropical cyclones, drought, bushfires, floods and other extreme weather events worldwide. Potential future changes in such extreme El Niño occurrences could have profound socio-economic consequences. Here we present climate modelling evidence for a doubling in the occurrences in the future in response to greenhouse warming. We estimate the change by aggregating results from climate models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phases 3 (CMIP3; ref. 10) and 5 (CMIP5; ref. 11) multi-model databases, and a perturbed physics ensemble. The increased frequency arises from a projected surface warming over the eastern equatorial Pacific that occurs faster than in the surrounding ocean waters, facilitating more occurrences of atmospheric convection in the eastern equatorial region.},

	abstract = {In conditions characterized by energetic constraints, such as in periods of low food availability, some trade-offs between reproduction and self-maintenance may be necessary; even year-round breeders may then be forced to exhibit some reproductive seasonality. Prior research has largely focused on female reproduction and physiology, and few studies have evaluated the impact of environmental factors on males. Here we assessed the effects of season and ambient temperatures on fecal glucocorticoid (fGC) and testosterone (fT) levels in male baboons in Amboseli, Kenya. The Amboseli basin is a highly challenging, semiarid tropical habitat that is characterized by strongly seasonal patterns of rainfall and by high ambient temperatures. We previously reported that female baboons were impacted by these challenging environmental conditions. We ask here whether male baboons in the same environment and groups as females exhibit similar physiological effects. We found that after accounting for male age and individual variability, males exhibited higher fGC levels and lower fT levels during the dry season than during the wet season. Furthermore, fT but not fGC levels were lower in months of high average daily maximum temperatures, suggesting a direct impact of heat on testes. Our results demonstrate that male baboons, like females, experience ecological stress that alters their reproductive physiology. The impact of the environment on male reproduction deserves more attention both in its own right and because alteration in male physiology may contribute to the reduction in female fertility observed inchallenging environments.

	abstract = {Seasonal changes in energy supply impose energetic constraints that affect many physiological and behavioral characteristics of organisms. As brains are costly, we predict brain size to be relatively small in species that experience a higher degree of seasonality (expensive brain framework). Alternatively, it has been argued that larger brains give animals the behavioral flexibility to buffer the effects of habitat seasonality (cognitive buffer hypothesis). Here, we test these two hypotheses in a comparative study on strepsirrhine primates (African lorises and Malagasy lemurs) that experience widely varying degrees of seasonality. We found that experienced seasonality is negatively correlated with relative brain size in both groups, controlling for the effect of phylogenetic relationships and possible confounding variables such as the extent of folivory. However, relatively larger‐brained lemur species tend to experience less variation in their dietary intake than indicated by the seasonality of their habitat. In conclusion, we found clear support for the hypothesis that seasonality restricts brain size in strepsirrhines as predicted by the expensive brain framework and weak support for the cognitive buffer hypothesis in lemurs.},

Yet the final descent to extinction is often driven by synergistic processes (amplifying feedbacks) that can be disconnected from the original cause of decline. We review recent observational, experimental and meta-analytic work which together show that owing to interacting and self-reinforcing processes, estimates of extinction risk for most species are more severe than previously recognised. As such, conservation actions which only target single-threat drivers risk being inadequate because of the cascading effects caused by unmanaged synergies. Future work should focus on how climate change will interact with and accelerate ongoing threats to biodiversity, such as habitat degradation, overexploitation and invasive species.},

	abstract = {In Africa, overhunting of tropical wildlife for food remains an intractable issue. Donors and governments remain committed to invest in efforts to both conserve and allow the sustainable use of wildlife. Four principal barriers need to be overcome: (i) communities are not motivated to conserve wildlife long-term because they have no formal rights to benefit from wildlife, or to exclude others from taking it on their land; (ii) multispecies harvests, typical of bushmeat hunting scenarios, place large-bodied species at risk of extinction; (iii) wildlife production cannot expand, in the same way that livestock farming can, to meet the expected growth in consumer demand; and (iv) wildlife habitat is lost through conversion to agriculture, housing, transportation networks and extractive industries. In this review, we examine the actors involved in the use of wildlife as food and discuss the possible solutions required to address urban and rural bushmeat consumption. Interventions must tackle use and conservation of wildlife through the application of context-relevant interventions in a variety of geographies across Africa. That said, for any bushmeat solution to work, there needs to be concurrent and comparable investment in strengthening the effectiveness of protected area management and enforcement of wildlife conservation laws.},

A major challenge is to parameterise spread models for many species. We introduce an approach that addresses this challenge, coupling a trait-based analysis with spatial population modelling to project spread rates for 15 000 virtual mammals with life histories that reflect those seen in the real world. Covariances among life-history traits are estimated from an extensive terrestrial mammal data set using Bayesian inference. We elucidate the relative roles of different life-history traits in driving modelled spread rates, demonstrating that any one alone will be a poor predictor. We also estimate that around 30\% of mammal species have potential spread rates slower than the global mean velocity of climate change. This novel trait-space-demographic modelling approach has broad applicability for tackling many key ecological questions for which we have the models but are hindered by data availability.},

Between 1997 and 2000, we collected data to evaluate the relationship between rainfall, ambient temperature, photoperiod and food availability and the annual distribution of mating behavior and births in 15 groups of monkeys in the forests of the Eastern Argentinean Chaco. Our data show that the area is highly seasonal, characterized by significant fluctuations in rainfall, temperature, photoperiod and food availability. There are two rain peaks in April and November and a dry season lasting from June to August. Monthly mean temperatures were on average 11°C lower during winter months than they were during summer months. Temperatures {\textless}10°C and {\textgreater}33°C were also frequent through the year. Days are 3 h longer during the summer than during the winter months. Insect abundance and the percentage of tree species producing fruits, flowers or new leaves reached a low in the coldest winter months. Mating was infrequent, and we only observed it between May and September. Half the births (n = 13) occurred during a 2-week period in October. Infant survival during the first 6 mo of life was high (96\%). Our findings suggest an environmental control of reproduction. Changes in photoperiod and temperature may promote reproductive activity in females that might conceive and begin pregnancy at a time void of high temperatures that could be metabolically challenging.},

	abstract = {The last decade's lemur research includes successes in discovering new living and extinct species and learning about the distribution, biogeography, physiology, behavior, and ecology of previously little-studied species. In addition, in both the dry forest and rain forest, long-term studies of lemur demography, life history, and reproduction, have been completed in conjunction with data on tree productivity, phenology, and climate. Lemurs contrast with anthropoids in several behavioral features, including female dominance, targeted female-female aggression, lack of sexual dimorphism regardless of mating system, sperm competition coupled with male-male aggression, high infant mortality, cathemerality, and strict seasonal breeding. Hypotheses to explain these traits include the “energy conservation hypothesis” (ECH) suggesting that harsh and unpredictable climate factors on the island of Madagascar have affected the evolution of female dominance, and the “evolutionary disequilibrium hypotheses” (EVDH) suggesting that the recent megafauna extinctions have influenced lemurs to become diurnal. These hypotheses are compared and contrasted in light of recent empirical data on climate, subfossils, and lemur behavior. New data on life histories of the rain forest lemurs at Ranomafana National Park give further support to the ECH. Birth seasons are synchronized within each species, but there is a 6-month distribution of births among species. Gestation and lactation lengths vary among sympatric lemurs, but all lemur species in the rain forest wean in synchrony at the season most likely to have abundant resources. Across-species weaning synchrony seen in Ranomafana corroborates data from the dry forest that late lactation and weaning is the life history event that is the primary focus of the annual schedule. Lemur adaptations may assure maximum offspring survival in this environment with an unpredictable food supply and heavy predation. In conclusion, a more comprehensive energy frugality hypothesis (EFH) is proposed, which postulates that the majority of lemur traits are either adaptations to conserve energy (e.g., low basal metabolic rate (BMR), torpor, sperm competition, small group size, seasonal breeding) or to maximize use of scarce resources (e.g., cathemerality, territoriality, female dominance, fibrous diet, weaning synchrony). Among primates, the isolated adaptive radiation of lemurs on Madagascar may have been uniquely characterized by selection toward efficiency to cope with the harsh and unpredictable island environment.

Brown howler monkey births (n = 34) occurred throughout the year, and birth frequencies did not differ between rainy and dry season months. The aseasonal birth patterns of the howler monkeys differed significantly from the dry season concentration and dry month peak in muriqui births (n = 23). We found no effects of infant sex or the number of females on interbirth intervals (IBIs) in our 10 howler monkey study troops. IBIs of brown howler monkeys averaged 21.2 ± 2.5 mo (n = 8, median = 21.0 mo), and were significantly shorter following dry season births than rainy season births. Their IBIs and yearling survivorship (74\%) were similar to those reported for other species of howler monkeys, but yearling survivorship was much lower than that of muriquis (94\%), whose IBIs were more than 12 mo longer than those of the howler monkeys. Our study extends comparative knowledge of birth patterns in Alouatta to a poorly known species, and provides insights into the different ways in which diet and life history may affect the timing of births in large-bodied platyrrhines under the same seasonal ecological conditions.

Here, we combine fecal ovarian hormone analysis with measurements of sex skin swellings and reproductive behavior to describe female reproduction in geladas living in the Simien Mountains National Park, Ethiopia. We collected 10 years of reproductive data from 197 females across 36 units, with hormone data from a subset of these females (60 females from 16 units). First, we use these data to calculate age at maturation, age at first birth, interbirth interval, menstrual cycle length, gestation length, and duration of postpartum amenorrhea. Second, we present composite profiles of ovarian hormones, i.e., estrogens, progestogens, and sex skin measures across reproductive stages. Third, we examine whether ovarian hormones, sex skin phenotypes, and/or reproductive behaviors reliably reflect fertility or pregnancy in female geladas. The reproductive parameters calculated from our data were similar to those in previous studies on geladas and within the range of those for closely-related baboon species. We were able to reliably identify fertility and pregnancy using fecal estrogens only. The tumescent sex skin phenotypes and reproductive behaviors associated with fertility were also observed across all reproductive stages. We suggest that their presence outside of fertility may be a by-product of the flexibility needed for one or more female counterstrategies to infanticide.},

Several new assessment approaches have been proposed for evaluating the vulnerability of species to climate change based on the expectation that established assessments such as the IUCN Red List need revising or superseding in light of the threat that climate change brings. However, although previous studies have identified ecological and life history attributes that characterize declining species or those listed as threatened, no study so far has undertaken a quantitative analysis of the attributes that cause species to be at high risk of extinction specifically due to climate change. We developed a simulation approach based on generic life history types to show here that extinction risk due to climate change can be predicted using a mixture of spatial and demographic variables that can be measured in the present day without the need for complex forecasting models. Most of the variables we found to be important for predicting extinction risk, including occupied area and population size, are already used in species conservation assessments, indicating that present systems may be better able to identify species vulnerable to climate change than previously thought. Therefore, although climate change brings many new conservation challenges, we find that it may not be fundamentally different from other threats in terms of assessing extinction risks.},

Based on greenhouse experiments, changes in temperature and rainfall, along with elevated CO2, are expected to impact the nutritional quality of leaves. Here, we show a decline in the quality of tree leaves 15 and 30 years after two previous studies in an undisturbed area of tropical forest in Kibale National Park, Uganda. After 30 years in a sample of multiple individuals of ten tree species, the mature leaves of all but one species increased in fiber concentrations, with a mean increase of 10\%; tagged individuals of one species increased 13\% in fiber. After 15 years, in eight tree species the fiber of young leaves increased 15\%, and protein decreased 6\%. Like many folivores, Kibale colobus monkeys select leaves with a high protein-to-fiber ratio, so for these folivores declining leaf quality could have a major impact. Comparisons among African and Asian forests show a strong correlation between colobine biomass and the protein-to-fiber ratio of the mature leaves from common tree species. Although this model, predicts a 31\% decline in monkey abundance for Kibale, we have not yet seen these declines.},

	abstract = {Nonhuman primates, our closest biological relatives, play important roles in the livelihoods, cultures, and religions of many societies and offer unique insights into human evolution, biology, behavior, and the threat of emerging diseases. They are an essential component of tropical biodiversity, contributing to forest regeneration and ecosystem health. Current information shows the existence of 504 species in 79 genera distributed in the Neotropics, mainland Africa, Madagascar, and Asia. Alarmingly, {\textasciitilde}60\% of primate species are now threatened with extinction and {\textasciitilde}75\% have declining populations. This situation is the result of escalating anthropogenic pressures on primates and their habitats—mainly global and local market demands, leading to extensive habitat loss through the expansion of industrial agriculture, large-scale cattle ranching, logging, oil and gas drilling, mining, dam building, and the construction of new road networks in primate range regions. Other important drivers are increased bushmeat hunting and the illegal trade of primates as pets and primate body parts, along with emerging threats, such as climate change and anthroponotic diseases. Often, these pressures act in synergy, exacerbating primate population declines. Given that primate range regions overlap extensively with a large, and rapidly growing, human population characterized by high levels of poverty, global attention is needed immediately to reverse the looming risk of primate extinctions and to attend to local human needs in sustainable ways. Raising global scientific and public awareness of the plight of the world’s primates and the costs of their loss to ecosystem health and human society is imperative.

These relationships can have important fitness consequences, but most studies do not explicitly measure those relationships. An approach that explicitly measures relationships will further our understanding of social complexity and the consequences of both direct and indirect interactions. Social network analysis is the study of social groups as networks of nodes connected by social ties. This approach examines individuals and groups in the context of relationships between group members. Application of social network analysis to animal behaviour can advance the field by identifying and quantifying specific attributes of social relationships, many of which are not captured by more common measures of sociality, such as group size. Sophisticated methods for network construction and analysis exist in other fields, but until recently, have seen relatively little application to animal systems. We present a brief history of social network analysis, a description of basic concepts and previous applications to animal behaviour. We then highlight relevance and constraints of some network measures, including results from an original study of the effect of sampling on network parameter estimates, and we end with promising directions for research. By doing so, we provide a prospective overview of social network analysis' general utility for the study of animal social behaviour.},

Animals are embedded in dynamically changing networks of relationships with conspecifics. These dynamic networks are fundamental aspects of their environment, creating selection on behaviours and other traits. However, most social network-based approaches in ecology are constrained to considering networks as static, despite several calls for such analyses to become more dynamic.



*
There are a number of statistical analyses developed in the social sciences that are increasingly being applied to animal networks, of which stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOMs) are a principal example. SAOMs are a class of individual-based models designed to model transitions in networks between discrete time points, as influenced by network structure and covariates. It is not clear, however, how useful such techniques are to ecologists, and whether they are suited to animal social networks.



*
We review the recent applications of SAOMs to animal networks, outlining findings and assessing the strengths and weaknesses of SAOMs when applied to animal rather than human networks. We go on to highlight the types of ecological and evolutionary processes that SAOMs can be used to study.



*
SAOMs can include effects and covariates for individuals, dyads and populations, which can be constant or variable. This allows for the examination of a wide range of questions of interest to ecologists. However, high-resolution data are required, meaning SAOMs will not be useable in all study systems. It remains unclear how robust SAOMs are to missing data and uncertainty around social relationships.



*
Ultimately, we encourage the careful application of SAOMs in appropriate systems, with dynamic network analyses likely to prove highly informative. Researchers can then extend the basic method to tackle a range of existing questions in ecology and explore novel lines of questioning.},

	abstract = {The structure of dominance relationships among individuals in a population is known to influence their fitness, access to resources, risk of predation, and even energy budgets. Recent advances in global positioning system radio telemetry provide data to evaluate the influence of social relationships on population spatial structure and ranging tactics. Using current models of socio-ecology as a framework, we explore the spatial behaviors relating to the maintenance of transitive (i.e., linear) dominance hierarchies between elephant social groups despite the infrequent occurrence of contests over resources and lack of territorial behavior. Data collected from seven families of different rank demonstrate that dominant groups disproportionately use preferred habitats, limit their exposure to predation/conflict with humans by avoiding unprotected areas, and expend less energy than subordinate groups during the dry season. Hence, our data provide strong evidence of rank derived spatial partitioning in this migratory species. These behaviors, however, were not found during the wet season, indicating that spatial segregation of elephants is related to resource availability. Our results indicate the importance of protecting preexisting social mechanisms for mitigating the ecological impacts of high density in this species. This analysis provides an exemplar of how behavioral research in a socio-ecological framework can serve to identify factors salient to the persistence and management of at risk species or populations.},

	abstract = {Behavioral traits are likely to influence species vulnerability to anthropogenic threats and in consequence, their risk of extinction. Several studies have addressed this question and have highlighted a correlation between reproductive strategies and different viability proxies, such as introduction success and local extinction risk. Yet, very few studies have investigated the effective impact of social behaviour, and evidence regarding global extinction risk remains scant. Here we examined the effects of three main behavioral factors: the group size, the social and reproductive system, and the strength of sexual selection on global extinction risk. Using Primates as biological model, we performed comparative analysis on 93 species. The conservation status as described by the IUCN Red List was considered as a proxy for extinction risk. In addition, we added previously identified intrinsic factors of vulnerability to extinction, and a measure of the strength of the human impact for each species, described by the human footprint. Our analysis highlighted a significant effect of two of the three studied behavioral traits, group size and social and reproductive system. Extinction risk is negatively correlated with mean group size, which may be due to an Allee effect resulting from the difficulties for solitary and monogamous species to find a partner at low densities. Our results also indicate that species with a flexible mating system are less vulnerable. Taking into account these behavioral variables is thus of high importance when establishing conservation plans, particularly when assessing species relative vulnerability.},

Of 2940 displacement episodes, 27\% occurred over natural food, 26\% over provisioned food, 8\% over grooming, 23\% over position and shade, and 16\% for other reasons. It was possible to reconstruct a displacement hierarchy that was linear and stable over short periods but fluctuated according to the age composition of the troop, resulting in an age inversed dominance structure. Females occupied top ranks as soon as they experienced menarche (around 2.4 years of age) and gradually declined thereafter, with postmenopausal females (≥30 years) being the lowest ranking individuals. Old females tended to be peripheral, while young females were highly social and active. Fertility peaked at about 7 years and gradually decreased thereafter, but infant mortality was much higher in young females than in old ones. During years when females gave birth, their ranks, especially those of old females, were higher than the average expectation for their age class, which suggests that females compete more vigorously if they have an infant. Reproductive success (i.e., infant survival to ≥2 years) declined significantly from high-over middle-to low-ranking females but did not differ for the three age classes investigated, because the higher fecundity of young females was balanced by better rearing success of older females. These results are discussed in light of the controversy over whether the langur social system is strongly influenced by kin selection (Hrdy and Hrdy, 1976; Dolhinow et al., 1979).},

	abstract = {In species with permanent groups, the groups tend to move toward a size where competition for food regulates female fitness. Hence, one would expect females to use behavioural means to gain a reproductive advantage over other females in the group. Their competitive ability is likely to reflect dominance rank and age. Adult female Sumatran long-tailed macaques, Macaca fascicularis, in four different groups were studied. Females of a higher dominance rank had a total food intake equal to or higher than that of the lower-ranking females, acquired it at a lower energy cost and probably ate food of higher quality. The older and lower-ranking females avoided competition by more often moving away from the centre of the group. Mortality fell more heavily on females who were less frequently present in the main party. High-ranking females tended to produce more offspring surviving to 1-year, with top-ranking females tending to out-reproduce all others. It is concluded that safety monopolization was the predominant mode of competition among the females caused by the monopolization of clumped food within the main party by high-ranking females.},

	abstract = {Premature loss of offspring decreases direct fitness of parents. In gregarious mammals, both ecological and social variables impact offspring survival and may interact with each other in this regard. Although a number of studies have investigated factors influencing offspring loss in mammals, we still know very little on how different factors interact with one another. We therefore investigated fetal and infant mortality in 3 large groups of wild crested macaques (Macaca nigra) over a period of up to 5 years by including potential social causes such as maternal dominance rank, male immigration, between group encounters, and ecological conditions such as rainfall in a multivariate survival analysis using Cox proportional hazards model. Infant but not fetal survival was most impaired after a recent takeover of the alpha-male position by an immigrant male. Furthermore, infant survival probability increased when there was an increase in number of group adult females and rainfall. Fetal survival probability also increased with an increase of these 2 factors, but more in high-ranking than low-ranking females. Fetal survival, unlike that of infants, was also improved by an increase of intergroup encounter rates. Our study thus stresses the importance of survival analyses using a multivariate approach and encompassing more than a single offspring stage to investigate the determinants of female direct fitness. We further provide evidence for fitness costs and benefits of group living, possibly deriving from high pressures of both within- and between-group competition, in a wild primate population.},

Social structure has been shown to impact longevity, reproductive success, transmission of pathogens and information, and also play important role in the evolution of cooperation. Studies of the determinants of social structure have identified environmental, genetic, and structural factors in a variety of species. At the same time, most studies in the field have been descriptive in approach, statistically identifying patterns in social networks constructed from observed interactions. We argue that there is a need for predictive theory to complement descriptive studies, moving the field from pattern to process. As an example, we provide a simple model of the effect of personality on social network structure and social role differentiation. Our model suggests that variation in behavioral types can result in variation in individual social network traits, and that some patterns found in animal networks in the wild, such as assortativity with respect to personality, may be outcomes of social inheritance and individual variation in it. Our approach and results exemplify the potential of generative models to connect individual-level processes to emergent patterns and advance our understanding of social complexity in nature.},

	abstract = {1.In mammals, maternal expenditure on offspring is a complex mix of several factors including the species’ mating system, offspring sex and the condition and age of the mother. While theory suggests that in polygynous species mothers should wean larger male offspring than females when resources and maternal conditions allow, the evidence for this remains equivocal. 2.Southern elephant seals are highly dimorphic, polygynous capital breeders existing in an environment with highly variable resources and should therefore provide clear evidence to support the theoretical expectations of differential maternal expenditure in male and female pups. 3.We quantified maternal size (mass and length) and pup size at birth and weaning for 342 elephant seal mothers at Macquarie Island. The study was conducted over 11 years of contrasting sea-ice and Southern Annular Mode values, both indices of maternal prey resources. 4.Overall, large females weaned male pups that weighed 17 kg (15.5\%) more than female pups. Maternal condition varied by as much as 59 kg among years, and was positively related to SAM, and negatively to maximum sea-ice extent. Smaller mothers weaned relatively larger male pups under favourable conditions, this effect was less apparent for larger mothers. 5.We developed a simple model linking environmental variation to maternal masses post-partum, followed by maternal masses post-partum to weaning masses and then weaning masses to pup survival and demonstrated that environmental conditions affected predicted survival so that the pups of small mothers had an estimated 7\% increase in first year survival in “good” vs “bad” years compared to 1\% for female pups of large mothers. 6.Co-occurrence of environmental quality and conservative reproductive tactics suggests that mothers retain substantial plasticity in maternal care, enhancing their lifetime reproductive success by adjusting reproductive expenditure relative to both prevailing environmental conditions and their own capabilities.

Smaller, degraded forest fragments that surround the BFMS also contain C. vellerosus and may provide an important habitat for the monkeys. Our objectives were to 1) determine the current population size and density of C. vellerosus at BFMS and in five surrounding fragments, 2) examine the differences in demographics between the fragments and BFMS, and 3) determine whether a relationship exists between population density and fragment size and isolation distance from BFMS. The census was a complete count and was conducted for 1 month (July 2003) by S.W. and trained research assistants. Seven census routes were walked simultaneously on 13 days. The 2003 population estimate of C. vellerosus at BFMS was 217–241 individuals (15 groups), a slight increase from the 2000 census. Numbers in the fragments (58–62, six groups) have remained stable since 1997, when the only other census of these fragments was conducted. Mean group size did not differ between the fragments and BFMS. Larger fragments had larger numbers of colobus, but there was no relationship between fragment size and colobus density. Isolation distance had no effect on population density. Our data suggest that colobus probably travel between fragments.

	abstract = {Numerous animal species currently experience habitat loss and fragmentation. This might result in behavioral and dietary adjustments, especially because fruit availability is frequently reduced in fragments. Food scarcity can result in elevated physiological stress levels, and chronic stress often has detrimental effects on individuals. Some animal species exhibit a high degree of fission–fusion dynamics, and theory predicts that these species reduce intragroup feeding competition by modifying their subgroup size according to resource availability. Until now, however, there have been few studies on how species with such fission–fission dynamics adjust their grouping patterns and social behavior in small fragments or on how food availability influences their stress levels. We collected data on fruit availability, feeding behavior, stress hormone levels (measured through fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGCM)), subgroup size, and aggression for two groups of brown spider monkeys (Ateles hybridus) in a small forest fragment in Colombia and examined whether fruit availability influences these variables. Contrary to our predictions, spider monkeys ranged in smaller subgroups, had higher FGCM levels and higher aggression rates when fruit availability was high compared to when it was low. The atypical grouping pattern of the study groups seems to be less effective at mitigating contest competition over food resources than more typical fission–fusion patterns. Overall, our findings illustrate that the relationship between resource availability, grouping patterns, aggression rates, and stress levels can be more complex than assumed thus far. Additional studies are needed to investigate the long-term consequences on the health and persistence of spider monkeys in fragmented habitats.},

	abstract = {Patterns of coalitionary aggression among female animals are generally explained by kin selection theory. Frequent female coalitions are almost exclusively observed in female-philopatric species, where females stay in their natal group, and females typically form coalitions with their kin. Bonobos, Pan paniscus, in contrast, are male-philopatric, with females emigrating to new groups at adolescence, but female bonobos frequently form coalitions even though they are generally with nonrelatives. Here we investigated the patterns of female coalitions in a group of wild bonobos at Wamba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, in order to explore alternative mechanisms to kin selection for cooperation among females. We found that all female coalitions (defined as coalitions in which two or more females participated) were formed to attack males, usually after the male(s) behaved aggressively towards one or more females. There was no evidence that female bonobos used proximity, grooming or genito-genital rubbing (GG-rubbing) to develop coalition partnerships, although higher association provided females with more opportunity to form coalitions. Instead of reciprocal agonistic support, we found a unidirectional pattern in which older females supported younger females. Females defeated males more easily when they formed coalitions than when they confronted males alone. Unlike female coalitions in other species that use coalitions to cope with competition among females, our results suggest that coalitions in female bonobos might have evolved as a counterstrategy against male harassment. Females might choose their coalition partners based not on affiliative relationship or reciprocity but on mutualism. In contrast to the hypothesis that affiliative behaviour leads to coalition formation, coalitions might in fact increase gregariousness among females, leading females to develop affiliative interactions that promote tolerance.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Fragmentation and habitat destruction are 2 factors driving the current decline of mammal populations. Spider monkeys Ateles spp. are some of the first neotropical mammals to go extinct after fragmentation, as they (1) are large-bodied, specialized frugivores that require large areas to subsist, (2) are preferred targets for local hunters, (3) have slow reproductive cycles, and (4) rarely move between adjacent forest fragments. Brown spider monkeys A. hybridus are Critically Endangered, and most of their historical habitat has either been cleared or is seriously fragmented. We conducted census surveys at 2 areas in Colombia (Las Quinchas and San Juan) in order to compare the population density of brown spider monkeys, red howler monkeys Alouatta seniculus, and white-fronted capuchins Cebus albifrons in both continuous forest and recently fragmented forest in each of these 2 areas. We found a higher density of brown spider monkeys and red howler monkeys in recent fragments at both sites, while differences were not consistent for white-fronted capuchins. We suggest that these patterns could be explained by the constrained ability of spider monkeys and howler monkeys to move between forest fragments and to exploit impacted or degraded areas. In the absence of hunting, the immediate effects of fragmentation on spider monkeys seem to lead to a sudden increase in population density as a result of a decreasing forested area, while maintaining population numbers relatively stable. Longer-term research will lead to the identification of the proximate factors leading to the generalized pattern of local extinction of spider monkey populations in small isolated fragments.},

Global climate phenomena such as El Niño Southern Oscillations may have confounding impacts on the island’s threatened biota but these effects are less well known. We performed a demographic study of Propithecus edwardsi, a lemur inhabiting the eastern rainforest of Madagascar, to evaluate the impact of deforestation, hunting, and El Niño on its population and to re-evaluate present endangerment categorization under the IUCN. Over 18 years of demographic data, including survival and fecundity rates were used to parameterize a stochastic population model structured with three stage classes (yearlings, juveniles, and adults). Results demonstrate that hunting and deforestation are the most significant threats to the population. Analysis of several plausible scenarios and combinations of threat revealed that a 50\% population decline within three generations was very likely, supporting current IUCN classification. However, the analysis also suggested that changing global cycles may pose further threat. The average fecundity of lemurs was over 65\% lower during El Niño years. While not as severe as deforestation or hunting, if El Niño events remain at the current high frequency there may be negative consequences for the population. We suggest that it is most critical for this species continued survival to create more protected areas, not only to thwart hunting and deforestation, but also to give this endangered lemur a better chance to recover from and adapt to altered climate cycles in the future.},

	abstract = {Other than the hominin lineage, baboons are the diurnally active primates that have colonized the arid plains of Africa most successfully. While the hominin lineage adopted bipedalism before colonizing the open, dry plains, baboons retained a quadrupedal mode of locomotion. Because bipedalism has been considered to reduce the thermoregulatory stress of inhabiting open dry plains, we investigated how baboons cope with thermal loads and water restriction. Using implanted data loggers, we measured abdominal temperature every 5 min in six unrestrained baboons while they were exposed to simulated desert conditions (15 °C at night rising to 35 °C during the day, with and without extra radiant heating), or an ambient temperature of 22 °C. At 22 °C, core temperature averaged 37.9 °C and cycled nychthemerally by 1.7 °C. Mean, minimum, and maximum daily core temperatures in euhydrated baboons in the simulated desert environments did not differ from the temperatures displayed in the 22 °C environment, even when radiant heating was applied. At 22 °C, restricting water intake did not affect core temperature. During the desert simulations, maximum core temperature increased significantly on each day of water deprivation, with the highest temperatures (\&gt;40 °C) on the third day in the simulation that included radiant heat. When drinking water heated to 38 °C was returned, core temperature decreased rapidly to a level lower than normal for that time of day. We conclude that baboons with access to water can maintain homeothermy in the face of high air temperatures and radiant heat loads, but that a lack of access to drinking water poses a major threat to baboon homeothermy. We speculate that any competitive thermoregulatory advantage of bipedalism in early hominins was related to coping with water shortage in hot environments, and that their freed hands might have enabled them to transport enough water to avoid dangerous hyperthermia.},

In this review, we argue that many central issues in behavioural ecology will soon become prohibitively difficult to investigate and interpret, thus impeding the rapid progress that characterizes the field. To address these challenges, behavioural ecologists should design studies not only to answer basic scientific questions but also to provide ancillary information for protection and management of their study organisms and habitats, and then share their biological insights with the applied conservation community.},

	abstract = {We discuss three interlinked issues: the natural pace of environmental change and adaptation, the likelihood that a population will adapt to a potentially lethal change, and adaptation to elevated CO2, the prime mover of global change. 1. Environmental variability is governed by power laws showing that ln difference in conditions increases with ln elapsed time at a rate of 0.3–0.4. This leads to strong but fluctuating selection in many natural populations. 2. The effect of repeated adverse change on mean fitness depends on its frequency rather than its severity. If the depression of mean fitness leads to population decline, however, severe stress may cause extinction. Evolutionary rescue from extinction requires abundant genetic variation or a high mutation supply rate, and thus a large population size. Although natural populations can sustain quite intense selection, they often fail to adapt to anthropogenic stresses such as pollution and acidification and instead become extinct. 3. Experimental selection lines of algae show no specific adaptation to elevated CO2, but instead lose their carbon-concentrating mechanism through mutational degradation. This is likely to reduce the effectiveness of the oceanic carbon pump. Elevated CO2 is also likely to lead to changes in phytoplankton community composition, although it is not yet clear what these will be. We emphasize the importance of experimental evolution in understanding and predicting the biological response to global change. This will be one of the main tasks of evolutionary biologists in the coming decade.},

I examine whether mammals with larger levels of RE are more or less likely to be at risk of endangerment than less-encephalized species. I find that extant species with large levels of encephalization are at greater risk of endangerment, with this effect being strongest in species with small body sizes. These results suggest that RE could be a valuable asset in estimating extinction vulnerability. Additionally, these findings suggest that the cost–benefit trade-off of RE is different in large-bodied species when compared with small-bodied species.},

Here we provide an analysis showing that bushmeat hunting for mostly food and medicinal products is driving a global crisis whereby 301 terrestrial mammal species are threatened with extinction. Nearly all of these threatened species occur in developing countries where major coexisting threats include deforestation, agricultural expansion, human encroachment and competition with livestock. The unrelenting decline of mammals suggests many vital ecological and socio-economic services that these species provide will be lost, potentially changing ecosystems irrevocably. We discuss options and current obstacles to achieving effective conservation, alongside consequences of failure to stem such anthropogenic mammalian extirpation. We propose a multi-pronged conservation strategy to help save threatened mammals from immediate extinction and avoid a collapse of food security for hundreds of millions of people.},

	abstract = {Gorillas living in western central Africa (Gorilla gorilla) are morphologically and genetically distinguishable from those living in eastern central Africa (Gorilla beringei). Genomic analyses show eastern gorillas experienced a significant reduction in population size during the Pleistocene subsequent to geographical isolation from their western counterparts. However, how these results relate more specifically to the recent biogeographical and evolutionary history of eastern gorillas remains poorly understood. Here we show that two rare morphological traits are present in the hands and feet of both eastern gorilla subspecies at strikingly high frequencies ({\textgreater}60\% in G. b. graueri; ∼28\% in G. b. beringei) in comparison with western gorillas ({\textless}1\%). The intrageneric distribution of these rare traits suggests that they became common among eastern gorillas after diverging from their western relatives during the early to middle Pleistocene. The extremely high frequencies observed among grauer gorillas—which currently occupy a geographic range more than ten times the size of that of mountain gorillas—imply that grauers originated relatively recently from a small founding population of eastern gorillas. Current paleoenvironmental, geological, and biogeographical evidence supports the hypothesis that a small group of eastern gorillas likely dispersed westward from the Virungas into present-day grauer range in the highlands just north of Lake Kivu, either immediately before or directly after the Younger Dryas interval. We propose that as the lowland forests of central Africa expanded rapidly during the early Holocene, they became connected with the expanding highland forests along the Albertine Rift and enabled the descendants of this small group to widely disperse. The descendant populations significantly expanded their geographic range and population numbers relative to the gorillas of the Virunga Mountains and the Bwindi-Impenetrable Forest, ultimately resulting in the grauer gorilla subspecies recognized today. This founder-effect hypothesis offers some optimism for modern conservation efforts to save critically endangered eastern gorillas from extinction.

Over the last 30 years spatial ecology has developed as an integrative, multidisciplinary science that has improved our understanding of the ecological consequences of habitat fragmentation and loss. We argue that accelerating climate change – the effective manipulation of time by humans – has generated a current need to build an equivalent framework for temporal ecology. Climate change has at once pressed ecologists to understand and predict ecological dynamics in non-stationary environments, while also challenged fundamental assumptions of many concepts, models and approaches. However, similarities between space and time, especially related issues of scaling, provide an outline for improving ecological models and forecasting of temporal dynamics, while the unique attributes of time, particularly its emphasis on events and its singular direction, highlight where new approaches are needed. We emphasise how a renewed, interdisciplinary focus on time would coalesce related concepts, help develop new theories and methods and guide further data collection. The next challenge will be to unite predictive frameworks from spatial and temporal ecology to build robust forecasts of when and where environmental change will pose the largest threats to species and ecosystems, as well as identifying the best opportunities for conservation.},

	abstract = {Objectives

One-male social systems are usually characterized by polygyny and reproductive exclusion by a single resident male. Sometimes, however, secondary males join these groups, and this may carry fitness costs and/or benefits to the resident male. In hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas hamadryas), which live in one-male units (OMUs) with female defense polygyny within a multi-level social system, secondary “follower” males often reside in OMUs. Our aim here is to examine possible benefits of these secondary males to hamadryas resident males.


Materials and Methods

Using 6 years of data from 65 OMUs in a band of wild hamadryas baboons in Ethiopia, we compared demographic and reproductive parameters of OMUs with and without secondary “follower” males to assess whether their presence conferred any reproductive benefits to resident “leader” males.


Results

Leaders with followers had tenure lengths almost twice as long, acquired more than twice as many females, retained females longer, and had three times as many infants during their tenure compared to leaders without followers.


Discussion

Hamadryas follower males enabled leaders to retain females for longer periods of time—likely through unit defense, social relationships with OMU members, and/or infant protection. Hamadryas leaders appear to be able to monopolize access to females despite the presence of followers, and as such any enhanced reproduction derived from the presence of followers likely increases the fitness of the leader rather than the follower. Thus the relationship between leaders and followers in hamadryas society appears to be a mutually beneficial one and tolerance of secondary males may be an adaptive reproductive strategy characterizing hamadryas leader males.

	abstract = {In promiscuous primates, interactions between adult males and infants have rarely been investigated. However, recent evidence suggests that male affiliation towards infants has an influence on several aspects of the infants’ life. Furthermore, affiliations may be associated with male reproductive strategy. In this study, we examined which social factors influenced male-infant affiliation initiated by either male or infant, in wild crested macaques (Macaca nigra). We combined behavioral data and genetic paternity analysis from 30 infants living in three wild groups in Tangkoko Reserve, Indonesia. Our results indicate that adult males and infants do not interact at random, but rather form preferential associations. The social factors with the highest influence on infant-initiated interactions were male rank and male association with the infant’s mother. While infants initiated affiliations with males more often in the absence of their mothers, adult males initiated more affiliations with infants when their mothers were present. Furthermore, males initiated affiliations more often when they were in the same group at the time the infant was conceived, when they held a high dominance rank, or when they had a close relationship with the mother. Interestingly, paternity did not affect male-infant affiliation despite being highly skewed in this species. Overall, our results suggest that adult males potentially associate with an infant to secure future mating with the mother. Infants are more likely to associate with a male to receive better support, suggesting a strategy to increase the chance of infant survival in a primate society with high infant mortality.Significance statementWe explore social relationships between males and infants in a promiscuous primate, the wild crested macaque. Our novel approach addresses the nature of affiliations both from males’ and infants’ perspectives. The results show that males and infants form preferential associations. Male-female affiliation, but not paternity, was a significant predictor of interactions initiated both by males and infants. Males initiated more interactions towards infants when the mother was in proximity, while infants initiated more interactions in her absence. Finally, high-ranking males were more likely to initiate interactions towards infants. We demonstrated that paternity is not a good predictor of male-infant affiliations, even in a species with a high reproductive skew and a relatively high confidence of paternity. Our paper is one of the first to show that infants are active agents in establishing and maintaining preferential relationships with males.},

	abstract = {Secondary forests are now prominent features in Neotropical landscapes, yet little is known about their conservation value for nonvolant mammalian communities. We performed a 20-month study using transect walks to survey the nonvolant mammal fauna in primary and secondary forests at La Selva Biological Station in the Caribbean lowlands of northeastern Costa Rica. We found that secondary forests can hold complex mammalian communities and no species exhibited habitat preferences between primary and secondary forests. With few exceptions, behavioral and group dynamic characteristics of mammal species were similar between forest types. Our research allows us to address methodological questions and assess the effectiveness of transect sampling. Monthly detection rates vary widely by species and likely reflect short-term changes in behavior rather than population fluctuations. Air temperature and rainfall are the factors most associated with monthly detection rates for various species. Small-scale areas of higher and lower use are evident for several species. Neither time of morning for surveys nor number of observers per trail affects detection rate. We report current abundances for the most commonly observed species and note generally lower densities in the Caribbean lowlands than elsewhere in the Neotropics. This research highlights that in less seasonal, evergreen forests climatic factors can still affect mammalian behavior. Overall, we find that secondary forests are of high conservation value and that transect walks are an effective methodology to sample many nonvolant mammal species, and we present recommendations on how to sample properly to conduct rigorous and long-term studies.Los bosques secundarios son mucho más comunes en el neotrópico, pero poco se sabe sobre su importancia en la conservación de comunidades de mamíferos no voladores. Durante 20 meses llevamos a cabo un estudio usando líneas de transectos para investigar la fauna de mamíferos no voladores en bosques primarios y secundarios en la Estación Biológica La Selva en las tierras bajas caribeñas al noreste de Costa Rica. Pudimos constatar que los bosques secundarios pueden albergarcomplejas comunidades de mamíferos y ninguna especie exhibe preferencias de hábitat entre bosque primario y secundario. Con pocas excepciones, las características dinámicas de grupo y comportamiento de especies de mamíferos fueron similares entre los dos tipos de bosque. Nuestra investigación nos permite abordar cuestiones metodológicas y evaluar la eficacia del muestreo con transectos. Las tasas mensuales de detección varían de acuerdo a la especie y probablemente reflejan cambios a corto plazo en las fluctuaciones del comportamiento en vez de la población. La temperatura del aire y la precipitación son los factores más asociados con las tasas mensuales de detección de distintas especies. Encontramos que varias especies muestran diferentes incidencias de uso en zonas pequeñas. Ni la hora de la mañana, ni el número de observadores en las encuestas por transecto afectan la tasa de detección. Presentamos la abundancia actual de las especies más comúnmente observadas y notamos en general bajas densidades en las tierras bajas del Caribe más que en otras partes del neotrópico. Esta investigación resalta que en los bosques menos estacionales, factores climáticos aún pueden afectar el comportamiento de mamíferos. En general, encontramos que los bosques secundarios son de alto valor para la conservación y que los muestreos en transectos son una metodología eficaz para estudiar muchas especies de mamíferos no voladores y presentamos recomendaciones sobre cómo llevar a cabo muestreos adecuados para realizar estudios rigurosos a largo plazo.},

In all areas of human endeavor, from biology to medicine, economics, and climate science, we are flooded with large-scale data sets. These data sets describe intricate real-world systems from different and complementary viewpoints, with entities being modeled as nodes and their connections as edges, comprising large networks. These networked data are a new and rich source of domain-specific information, but that information is currently largely hidden within the complicated wiring patterns. Deciphering these patterns is paramount, because computational analyses of large networks are often intractable, so that many questions we ask about the world cannot be answered exactly, even with unlimited computer power and time (1). Hence, the only hope is to answer these questions approximately (that is, heuristically) and prove how far the approximate answer is from the exact, unknown one, in the worst case. On page 163 of this issue, Benson et al. (2) take an important step in that direction by providing a scalable heuristic framework for grouping entities based on their wiring patterns and using the discovered patterns for revealing the higher-order organizational principles of several real-world networked systems.

Fear of humans has been proposed to act as a substitute, but new research identifies humans as a “super predator” globally far more lethal to mesocarnivores, and thus presumably far more frightening. Although much of the world now consists of human-dominated landscapes, there remains relatively little research regarding how behavioral responses to humans affect trophic networks, to the extent that no study has yet experimentally tested the relative fearfulness mesocarnivores demonstrate in reaction to humans versus nonhuman predators. Badgers (Meles meles) in Britain are a model mesocarnivore insofar as they no longer need fear native large carnivores (bears, Ursus arctos; wolves, Canis lupus) and now perhaps fear humans more. We tested the fearfulness badgers demonstrated to audio playbacks of extant (dog) and extinct (bear and wolf) large carnivores, and humans, by assaying the suppression of foraging behavior. Hearing humans affected latency to feed, vigilance, foraging time, number of feeding visits, and number of badgers feeding. Hearing dogs and bears had far lesser effects on latency to feed, and hearing wolves had no effects. Our results indicate fear of humans evidently cannot substitute for the fear large carnivores inspire in mesocarnivores because humans are perceived as far more frightening, which we discuss in light of the recovery of large carnivores in human-dominated landscapes.},

The conceptual framework of evolutionary biology emerged with the Modern Synthesis in the early twentieth century and has since expanded into a highly successful research program to explore the processes of diversification and adaptation. Nonetheless, the ability of that framework satisfactorily to accommodate the rapid advances in developmental biology, genomics and ecology has been questioned. We review some of these arguments, focusing on literatures (evo-devo, developmental plasticity, inclusive inheritance and niche construction) whose implications for evolution can be interpreted in two ways—one that preserves the internal structure of contemporary evolutionary theory and one that points towards an alternative conceptual framework. The latter, which we label the ‘extended evolutionary synthesis' (EES), retains the fundaments of evolutionary theory, but differs in its emphasis on the role of constructive processes in development and evolution, and reciprocal portrayals of causation. In the EES, developmental processes, operating through developmental bias, inclusive inheritance and niche construction, share responsibility for the direction and rate of evolution, the origin of character variation and organism–environment complementarity. We spell out the structure, core assumptions and novel predictions of the EES, and show how it can be deployed to stimulate and advance research in those fields that study or use evolutionary biology.},

The explosion of miniature sensors that are driving the boom in consumer electronics, such as smart phones, gaming platforms, and wearable fitness devices, are now becoming available to ecologists for remotely monitoring the activities of wild animals. While half a century ago researchers were attaching balloons to the backs of seals to measure their movement, today ecologists have access to an arsenal of sensors that can continuously measure most aspects of an animal's state (e.g., location, behavior, caloric expenditure, interactions with other animals) and external environment (e.g., temperature, salinity, depth). This technology is advancing our ability to study animal ecology by allowing researchers to (1) answer questions about the physiology, behavior, and ecology of wild animals in situ that would have previously been limited to tests on model organisms in highly controlled settings, (2) study cryptic or wide-ranging animals that have previously evaded investigation, and (3) develop and test entirely new theories. Here we explore how ecologists are using these tools to answer new questions about the physiological performance, energetics, foraging, migration, habitat selection, and sociality of wild animals, as well as collect data on the environments in which they live.},

Investigating how and why mating deviates from random is important for understanding evolutionary processes as well as informing conservation and management. Prior to the implementation of parentage analyses, understanding mating patterns in solitary, elusive species like bears was virtually impossible. Here, we capitalize on a long-term genetic data set collected from black bears (Ursus americanus) (N = 2422) in the Northern Lower Peninsula (NLP) of Michigan, USA. We identified mated pairs using parentage analysis and applied logistic regression (selection) models that controlled for features of the social network, to quantify the effects of individual characteristics, and spatial and population demographic factors on mating dynamics. Logistic regression models revealed that black bear mating was associated with spatial proximity of mates, male age, the time a pair had coexisted, local population density and relatedness. Mated pairs were more likely to contain older males. On average, bears tended to mate with nearby individuals to whom they were related, which does not support the existence of kin recognition in black bears. Pairwise relatedness was especially high for mated pairs containing young males. Restricted dispersal and high male turnover from intensive harvest mortality of NLP black bears are probably the underlying factors associated with younger male bears mating more often with female relatives. Our findings illustrate how harvest has the potential to disrupt the social structure of game species, which warrants further attention for conservation and management.},

	abstract = {Many nonhuman primates live in proximity to humans, and all studied primate populations are influenced in some ways by human interaction. While the effects of human interference on primate behavior and ecology are an important area of research in contemporary primatology, to date there is no systematic way to report the types or level of anthropogenic influence for a primate study population. In this paper, I introduce a diagnostic classification system that will allow primate field researchers to clearly and consistently report anthropogenic conditions at their study sites. This system provides a way to identify population conditions for four major variables: landscape, human–nonhuman primate interface, diet, and predation risk. The incredible diversity of the Order Primates necessitates a descriptive system that is applicable across a wide range of habitat types, social groupings, and ecological roles, so the proposed classification system has been specifically designed to avoid quantitative ranking. Instead, the system is intended to provide a standardized way to report a wealth of population and site information in a simple format. This will allow for meta-analysis of specific conditions across study sites, leading to a greater understanding of the effects of different forms of anthropogenic influence on primate behavior and ecology.

	abstract = {As one means to maximize access to females, males of some species are intolerant of other males in social units, resulting in female defense polygyny, a mating system in which one male monopolizes mating access to as many females as he can for as long as possible. In such a system, the length of a male's tenure and the number of females he is able to acquire are important predictors of his reproductive success. Hamadryas baboons differ from many other taxa with female defense polygyny in that they acquire and lose females individually, thus patterns of acquisition and loss of females over time are additional factors contributing to a male's fitness. Here, we describe longitudinal patterns of female acquisition and loss over a 9-year period in a group of 250 wild hamadryas baboons. Complete tenures of leader males ranged from 310 to 2,160 days (N = 13) and results from a survival analysis yielded a median tenure length of 2,160 days, or 6 years (N = 49). The total number of females acquired, which increased with tenure length, ranged from 1 to 14 and averaged 3.5, and leader males acquired females both opportunistically and via challenging other males. The interval between acquisition of successive females ranged from 0 to 1,196 days with a median of 203, and males acquired all of their females less than halfway into their tenure. Females from outside of a leader male's social sphere (clan and band) were acquired relatively later in their tenure compared to females from within a male's social sphere. Leaders typically lost females gradually during the latter part of their tenure or all (or most) at once, suggesting an inverted U-shaped longitudinal arc of male competitive ability. Am. J.

	abstract = {Savannah baboons are one of the few mammalian species that do not exhibit seasonal reproduction patterns and are therefore ideally suited to study the effect of female reproductive states (cycling, pregnant, lactating) on cortisol levels independent of seasonal factors. Fecal samples from 10 free-ranging female chacma baboons (Papio hamadryas ursinus), collected during a period of 17 months, were analyzed using a steroid-extraction method. Reproductive state had a significant effect on fecal cortisol, with lowest levels found in estrous females. Fertility was not related to fecal cortisol levels; we found no significant differences between samples collected on conceptive and nonconceptive cycles. Environmental factors explained most of the variance of fecal cortisol levels. Cortisol measures were strongly correlated with seasonal differences such as daylight duration, temperature and the amount of time that baboons spent resting. We measured higher cortisol levels during winter months and suggest that this could be related to shorter resting periods and to the cold minimum ambient temperatures at this study site. Finally, we found no relationship between social rank nor the rate of agonistic interactions with basal fecal cortisol levels.},

	abstract = {Social bonds, here defined as strong, equitable and enduring social relationships, increase fitness in both male and female primates irrespective of their dispersal regime. Despite the benefits they carry for some, social bonds evolved more often among female than among male primates which is thought to be caused by the unsharable nature of males’ limiting resource, fertilizations. Here we present a structured review of variation in primate male social relationships, mating systems, and social organization. In addition to classical socio-ecological reasoning and recent models on the evolution of male coalitions, we consider the phylogenetic history of species living in multi-male groups and alternative evolutionary routes to male co-residency, which may constrain the evolution of male social bonds in some cases. We summarize our results in a conceptual framework that represents the effects of male contest competition within and between groups on male social organization, affiliation and cooperation. We conclude that male social bonds evolved as long-term alliances that gain their adaptive function in within group contests and, thus, that the evolution of male social bonds is driven by variation in within group contest competition. Between group contest competition may select for large male group size but in the end it is the narrow window of medium to low within group contest competition that promotes the evolution of political coalitions and thus is responsible for the rarity of social bonds among primate males.},

We present evidence that (a) males who have evolved to participate in infant care have different endocrine profiles around offspring from males who have not evolved to regularly participate in infant care, (b) the energetic costs of reproduction in both males and females creates conditions conducive to elevated levels of both stress and sex hormones, (c) adolescent subfecundity among females evolved as a mechanism fostering mate choice, (d) some primate species are probably facultative ovulators, and (e) endocrine suppression of subordinate males probably does not contribute to delayed onset of reproduction but does contribute to reduced access to females, which hampers progeny production. Hormones and behavior are inextricably intertwined in a feedback relationship that regulates each other.},

	abstract = {In complex environments, behavioural plasticity depends on the ability of an animal to integrate numerous sensory stimuli. The multidimensionality of factors interacting to shape plastic behaviour means it is difficult for both organisms and researchers to predict what constitutes an adaptive response to a given set of conditions. Although researchers may be able to map the fitness pay-offs of different behavioural strategies in changing environments, there is no guarantee that the study species will be able to perceive these pay-offs. We thus risk a disconnect between our own predictions about adaptive behaviour and what is behaviourally achievable given the umwelt of the animal being studied. This may lead to erroneous conclusions about maladaptive behaviour in circumstances when the behaviour exhibited is the most adaptive possible given sensory limitations. With advances in the computational resources available to behavioural ecologists, we can now measure vast numbers of interactions among behaviours and environments to create adaptive behavioural surfaces. These surfaces have massive heuristic, predictive and analytical potential in understanding adaptive animal behaviour, but researchers using them are destined to fail if they ignore the sensory ecology of the species they study. Here, we advocate the continued use of these approaches while directly linking them to perceptual space to ensure that the topology of the generated adaptive landscape matches the perceptual reality of the animal it intends to study. Doing so will allow predictive models of animal behaviour to reflect the reality faced by the agents on adaptive surfaces, vastly improving our ability to determine what constitutes an adaptive response for the animal in question.},

	abstract = {Reproductive success is linked to dominance in male primates, reflecting the benefits of male competition. However, not all males compete successfully, suggesting that the costs of obtaining and maintaining high dominance status are significant. Here we examine the fecal metabolites of testosterone (fT) and dihydrotestosterone (fDHT) as bioactive androgens reflecting male reproductive effort, as well as fecal glucocorticoid (fGC) excretion as an index of stress in male white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus). We investigated the influence of female fertility (periovulatory vs. nonovulatory) on the hormonal responses of alpha and subordinate males. Over a 17-mo field season, we collected and analyzed weekly fecal samples (N = 992) from all 14 adult ({\textgreater} 10 yr) and subadult (≥ 6–10 yr) males residing in three study groups in the Santa Rosa Sector of the Área de Conservación Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Fecal samples (N {\textgreater} 2250) were also collected from group females (N = 28) to identify the fertile period using progesterone and estradiol assays. Alpha males had significantly higher fT, fDHT, and fGC levels than subordinate males independent of female reproductive state; further, adult subordinates had significantly higher fT, but not fDHT or fGC, than subadult subordinates. Male fT, fDHT, and fGC levels were significantly higher in the presence of fertile females, regardless of male dominance status and age. These findings indicate that the higher reproductive effort of alpha males comes with some costs (increased fGCs), and the presence of periovulatory females is associated with specific endocrine responses reflecting male reproductive effort and stress in white-faced capuchins.},

But many male mammals, including rhesus macaques (Macaco mulatta), undergo circannual weight changes concurrent with mating season activity. Four adult male rhesus macaques living in a heterosexual social group in an outdoor enclosure were studied over a 2-year period in order to ascertain potential mechanisms underlying seasonal weight changes. Alterations in weight were significantly correlated with changes in abdominal fat levels and in body mass index. Neither testosterone nor estradiol fluctuations were correlated with weight changes, but estradiol levels were significantly correlated with body mass index. The annual profile of changes in abdominal fat level reflected the annual profile of variation in circulating estradiol levels. The fatted male phenomenon appears to characterize circannual weight fluctuations in rhesus macaques. Seasonal weight changes resulting from fat deposition are suggested to provide a substrate for adipose tissue aromatization that yields elevated estradiol levels and enables males to forego feeding and concentrate their energy budgets on activities directly related to mate acquisition and retention.},

	abstract = {Abstract Early-life experiences can dramatically affect adult traits. However, the evolutionary origins of such early-life effects are debated. The predictive adaptive response hypothesis argues that adverse early environments prompt adaptive phenotypic adjustments that prepare animals for similar challenges in adulthood. In contrast, the developmental constraints hypothesis argues that early adversity is generally costly. To differentiate between these hypotheses, we studied two sets of wild female baboons: those born during low-rainfall, low-quality years and those born during normal-rainfall, high-quality years. For each female, we measured fertility-related fitness components during years in adulthood that matched and mismatched her early conditions. We found support for the developmental constraints hypothesis: females born in low-quality environments showed greater decreases in fertility during drought years than females born in high-quality environments, even though drought years matched the early conditions of females born in low-quality environments. Additionally, we found that females born in low-quality years to high-status mothers did not experience reduced fertility during drought years. These results indicate that early ecological adversity did not prepare individuals to cope with ecological challenges in later life. Instead, individuals that experienced at least one high-quality early environment—either ecological or social—were more resilient to ecological stress in later life. Together, these data suggest that early adversity carries lifelong costs, which is consistent with the developmental constraints hypothesis.},

Before that time, systematics was not at the forefront of the biological sciences, and few scientists considered phylogenetic relationships when investigating evolutionary questions. By contrast, systematic biology is now one of the most vigorous disciplines in biology, and the use of phylogenies not only is requisite in macroevolutionary studies but also has been applied to a wide range of topics and fields that no one could possibly have envisioned 30 years ago. My message is simple: phylogenies are fundamental to comparative biology, but they are not the be-all and end-all. Phylogenies are powerful tools for understanding the past, but like any tool, they have their limitations. In addition, phylogenies are much more informative about pattern than they are about process. The best way to fully understand the past—both pattern and process—is to integrate phylogenies with other types of historical data as well as with direct studies of evolutionary process.},

	abstract = {Demographic variation, such as changes in population size, affects group-living conditions and thus creates new opportunities for individuals to interact socially. To understand how this variation in the social environment affects social structure, we used social network analysis to explore affiliative behaviors of nonpup (i.e., 1 year or older), female, yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris). We examined 4 social attributes (outdegree, indegree, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality) to measure social plasticity in response to group size variation. We found that, in response to increases in group size, individuals established fewer social connections than possible, which suggests that marmots experience constraints on sociality. Similarly, closeness and betweenness centrality decreased as group size increased, suggesting that females are expected to lose influence over other members of the group as group size increases, and there are substantial constraints on marmots transmitting information to others in large groups. Our results also suggest that group-level responses, such as behavioral plasticity, can be explained by individual-level mechanisms that evaluate the costs and benefits of sociality. Interestingly, the mechanistic basis of these group-level responses may, at times, follow patterns expected by chance. We propose that further research is necessary to uncover the mechanisms underlying the individual-level behavioral response. Like group size effects studied in other domains, formally considering group size effects on social structure may shed novel light on the constraints on sociality.},

Animal social networks can be built either by observing individuals and defining links based on the occurrence of specific types of social interactions, or by linking individuals based on observations of physical proximity or group membership, given a certain behavioural activity. The latter approaches of discovering network structure require splitting the temporal observation stream into discrete events given an appropriate time resolution parameter. This process poses several non-trivial problems which have not received adequate attention so far. Here, using data from a study of passive integrated transponder (PIT)-tagged great tits Parus major, we discuss these problems, demonstrate how the choice of the extraction method and the temporal resolution parameter influence the appearance and properties of the retrieved network and suggest a modus operandi that minimises observer bias due to arbitrary parameter choice. Our results have important implications for all studies of social networks where associations are based on spatio-temporal proximity, and more generally for all studies where we seek to uncover the relationships amongst a population of individuals that are observed through a temporal data stream of appearance records.},

We show that gazing behavior from dogs, but not wolves, increased urinary oxytocin concentrations in owners, which consequently facilitated owners’ affiliation and increased oxytocin concentration in dogs. Further, nasally administered oxytocin increased gazing behavior in dogs, which in turn increased urinary oxytocin concentrations in owners. These findings support the existence of an interspecies oxytocin-mediated positive loop facilitated and modulated by gazing, which may have supported the coevolution of human-dog bonding by engaging common modes of communicating social attachment.
Gaze into my eyes
Humans bond emotionally as we gaze into each other's eyes—a process mediated by the hormone oxytocin. Nagasawa et al. show that such gaze-mediated bonding also exists between us and our closest animal companions, dogs (see the Perspective by MacLean and Hare). They found that mutual gazing increased oxytocin levels, and sniffing oxytocin increased gazing in dogs, an effect that transferred to their owners. Wolves, who rarely engage in eye contact with their human handlers, seem resistant to this effect.

	abstract = {Polymorphic species have been the focus of important work in evolutionary biology. It has been suggested that colour polymorphic species have specific evolutionary and population dynamics that enable them to persist through environmental changes better than less variable species. We suggest that recent empirical and theoretical work indicates that polymorphic species may be more vulnerable to extinction than previously thought. This vulnerability arises because these species often have a number of correlated sexual, behavioural, life history and ecological traits, which can have a simple genetic underpinning. When exacerbated by environmental change, these alternate strategies can lead to conflict between morphs at the genomic and population levels, which can directly or indirectly affect population and evolutionary dynamics. In this perspective we identify a number of ways in which the nature of the correlated traits, their underpinning genetic architecture, and the inevitable interactions between colour morphs can result in a reduction in population fitness. The principles illustrated here apply to all kinds of discrete polymorphism (e.g. behavioural syndromes), but we focus primarily on colour polymorphism because they are well studied. We urge further empirical investigation of the genetic architecture and interactions in polymorphic species to elucidate the impact on population fitness. This article is protected by copyright.

	abstract = {The arrival of farming in Europe beginning around 8,500 years ago required adaptation to new environments, pathogens, diets, and social organizations. While evidence of natural selection can be revealed by studying patterns of genetic variation in present-day people, these pattern are only indirect echoes of past events, and provide little information about where and when selection occurred. Ancient DNA makes it possible to examine populations as they were before, during and after adaptation events, and thus to reveal the tempo and mode of selection. Here we report the first genome-wide scan for selection using ancient DNA, based on 83 human samples from Holocene Europe analyzed at over 300,000 positions. We find five genome-wide signals of selection, at loci associated with diet and pigmentation. Surprisingly in light of suggestions of selection on immune traits associated with the advent of agriculture and denser living conditions, we find no strong sweeps associated with immunological phenotypes. We also report a scan for selection for complex traits, and find two signals of selection on height: for short stature in Iberia after the arrival of agriculture, and for tall stature on the Pontic-Caspian steppe earlier than 5,000 years ago. A surprise is that in Scandinavian hunter-gatherers living around 8,000 years ago, there is a high frequency of the derived allele at the EDAR gene that is the strongest known signal of selection in East Asians and that is thought to have arisen in East Asia. These results document the power of ancient DNA to reveal features of past adaptation that could not be understood from analyses of present-day people.},

	abstract = {Activity patterns have profound implications on primates’ morphology, physiology, and behavior and have likely driven their diversification. The last common ancestor of extant primates has been traditionally considered nocturnal although this notion has been recently debated due to emerging contradictory evidence. Previous studies underestimated the role of cathemerality (i.e., the ability to remain active throughout a 24-h cycle) by simplifying primate activity to the diurnal–nocturnal dichotomy. We estimated the evolutionary trajectories of activity patterns in primates and investigated how these may have influenced their diversification rates. We used a comprehensive data set to test multiple evolutionary hypotheses, following a robust Bayesian framework by using 5000 calibrated phylogenetic trees to account for phylogenetic uncertainty. Our results support a nocturnal ancestor that has shifted to diurnality in the Simiformes, has retained nocturnality in Lorisiformes and most Lemuriformes, and shifted to cathemerality in the ancestor of Lemuridae. The diversification of activity patterns in primates seems to have mainly arose by speciation rather than shifts between activity patterns, suggesting a low flexibility of diurnal and nocturnal patterns and the key importance of cathemeral activity as transitional state to shift between more specialized activity patterns. A cathemeral activity seems to appear well before diurnality in Malagasy lemurs, suggesting an ancient origin of this trait on the island and rejecting the hypothesis of a recent transition. The present research contributes to further disentangle the adaptive role of activity patterns in primate evolution.},

We studied whether larger social groups are more subdivided structurally. If so, the social subdivisions that form in larger groups may act as barriers to the spread of infection, weakening the association between group size and infectious disease. To investigate this ‘social bottleneck’ hypothesis, we examined the association between group size and four network structure metrics in 43 vertebrate and invertebrate species. We focused on metrics involving modularity, clustering, distance and centralization. In a meta-analysis of intraspecific variation in social networks, modularity showed positive associations with network size, with a weaker but still positive effect in cross-species analyses. Network distance also showed a positive association with group size when using intraspecific variation. We then used a theoretical model to explore the effects of subgrouping relative to other effects that influence disease spread in socially structured populations. Outbreaks reached higher prevalence when groups were larger, but subgrouping reduced prevalence. Subgrouping also acted as a ‘brake’ on disease spread between groups. We suggest research directions to understand the conditions under which larger groups become more subdivided, and to devise new metrics that account for subgrouping when investigating the links between sociality and infectious disease risk.},

	abstract = {Social status has been associated with health consequences, although the mechanisms by which status affects health are relatively unknown. At the physiological level, many studies have investigated the potential relationship between social behaviour/rank and physiological stress, with a particular focus on glucocorticoid (GC) production. GCs are of interest because of their experimentally established influence on health-related processes such as metabolism and immune function. Studies in a variety of species, in both naturalistic and laboratory settings, have led to complex outcomes. This paper reviews findings from primates and rodents and proposes a psychologically and physiologically relevant framework in which to study the relationship between social status and GC function. We (i) compare status-specific GC production between male and female primates, (ii) review the functional significance of different temporal patterns of GC production, (iii) propose ways to assess these temporal dynamics, and (iv) present novel hypotheses about the relationship between social status and GC temporal dynamics, and potential fitness and health implications. To understand whether GC production mediates social status-related fitness disparities, we must consider social contest conditions and the temporal dynamics of GC production. This framework will provide greater insights into the relationship between social status, physiological stress and health.},

	abstract = {Behavioral ecologists are increasingly adopting sophisticated non-invasive methods for measuring glucocorticoids from “excreta” because samples are easy to collect, animals are left undisturbed, and measures may be more reflective of external events than serum samples. Some of the most common predictors for hormone profiles in wild animals are seasonal changes in ecology and behavior. For example, we might expect baseline glucocorticoid levels to track changes in food availability or other seasonal stressors such as unusually high or low temperatures. Geladas (Theropithecus gelada) are one of the few non-human primates that live at extremely high altitudes where nighttime temperatures often dip below freezing. However, the physiological effects of this relatively inhospitable environment have never been examined in this species. Here we validate a “field-friendly” method of hormone extraction from gelada feces and demonstrate that this method can be used to detect seasonal and altitudinal differences in glucocorticoid metabolites for this species. We use two years of climatological and hormonal data from a wild population of geladas to test the hypothesis that geladas exhibit elevated glucocorticoids under environmentally “challenging” conditions — mainly, when temperatures and rainfall are low and altitude is high. Our results indicate that cold temperatures and high altitude predicted elevated glucocorticoids, but low rainfall did not. Therefore, we suggest a metabolic hypothesis (as opposed to a nutritional hypothesis) to explain this result. However, at the present time, we cannot rule out a behavioral stress hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Mountain gorillas are an endangered great ape subspecies and a prominent focus for conservation, yet we know little about their genomic diversity and evolutionary past. We sequenced whole genomes from multiple wild individuals and compared the genomes of all four Gorilla subspecies. We found that the two eastern subspecies have experienced a prolonged population decline over the past 100,000 years, resulting in very low genetic diversity and an increased overall burden of deleterious variation. A further recent decline in the mountain gorilla population has led to extensive inbreeding, such that individuals are typically homozygous at 34\% of their sequence, leading to the purging of severely deleterious recessive mutations from the population. We discuss the causes of their decline and the consequences for their future survival.
Genomes in the mist
The mountain gorilla is an iconic species that is at high risk of extinction. Xue et al. have sequenced 13 gorillas from two different populations to probe their genetic diversity. The genomes show large tracts of homozygosity and the loss of highly deleterious genetic variants, indicating population bottlenecks and inbreeding. This loss of genetic diversity appears to have started over 20,000 years ago and may have been caused by changes in climate and human-associated effects.

Explorative and bold behaviours often covary with contest behaviour and outcome, although there is evidence that the structure of these ‘behavioural syndromes' can change across situations. Aggression itself is typically repeatable, but also subject to high within-individual variation as a consequence of plastic responses to previous fight outcomes and opponent traits. Common proximate mechanisms (gene expression, endocrine control and metabolic rates) may underpin variation in both contest behaviour and general personality traits. Given the theoretical links between the evolution of fighting and of personality, we suggest that longitudinal studies of contest behaviour, combining behavioural and physiological data, would be a useful context for the study of animal personalities.},

Alexander [Alexander, 1989]. Evolution of the human psyche. In: Mellars P, Stringer C, editors. The human revolution: Behavioural and biological perspectives on the origins of modern humans. Princeton: Princeton University Press. p 455–513] proposed an integrative model for the evolution of human cognitive abilities and complex sociality that incorporates competition among coalitions of conspecifics (inter-group conflict) as a major selective pressure. However, one of the premises of this model, i.e., that when confronted with inter-group conflict selection should favor enhanced cognition, has remained empirically untested. Using a comparative approach on species data, I aimed to test the prediction that primate species (n = 104) that face greater inter-group conflict have higher cognitive abilities (indexed by endocranial volume). The degree of inter-group conflict/complexity was approximated via the variable home range overlap among groups. I found a significant relationship between home range overlap and endocranial volume, even after controlling for other predictor variables and covariates such as group size and body mass. I conclude that brain size evolution cannot be attributed exclusively to social factors such as group size, but likely reflects a variety of social and ecological determinants including inter-group conflict which poses cognitive demands on monitoring both the wider social milieu as well as spatial attributes of the habitat.

	abstract = {We develop statistical methods for phylogenetic logistic regression in which the dependent variable is binary (0 or 1) and values are nonindependent among species, with phylogenetically related species tending to have the same value of the dependent variable. The methods are based on an evolutionary model of binary traits in which trait values switch between 0 and 1 as species evolve up a phylogenetic tree. The more frequently the trait values switch (i.e., the higher the rate of evolution), the more rapidly correlations between trait values for phylogenetically related species break down. Therefore, the statistical methods also give a way to estimate the phylogenetic signal of binary traits. More generally, the methods can be applied with continuous- and/or discrete-valued independent variables. Using simulations, we assess the statistical properties of the methods, including bias in the estimates of the logistic regression coefficients and the parameter that estimates the strength of phylogenetic signal in the dependent variable. These analyses show that, as with the case for continuous-valued dependent variables, phylogenetic logistic regression should be used rather than standard logistic regression when there is the possibility of phylogenetic correlations among species. Standard logistic regression does not properly account for the loss of information caused by resemblance of relatives and as a result is likely to give inflated type I error rates, incorrectly identifying regression parameters as statistically significantly different from zero when they are not.},

	abstract = {Patterns of group social structure are often linked to the competitive regime within a social unit and to the availability of kin. In line with this, many studies have shown that the dispersing sex, which is considered to have fewer kin around, is less social, while the philopatric sex has strong social bonds. Chimpanzees were considered to fit well into this scheme with highly social and competing philopatric males and generally asocial and solitary dispersing females. However, recent data suggest that chimpanzee females can indeed be highly social, even though they are unlikely to be related to each other. We studied female sociality in a long-term habituated group living in the Taï Forest, Côte d'Ivoire. Female social relationships as measured by association and grooming preferences were well differentiated and long lasting. Association (and to a lesser extent grooming) bonds were associated with reduced aggression between social partners. In addition, the competitive regime as indicated by group size had a strong effect on female social networks, which were more centralized and less clustered in smaller groups, suggesting that competition may play a major role in shaping female chimpanzee sociality. These findings suggest that strong social bonds can occur even in the absence of a strong network of kin relationships.},

	abstract = {A large body of theoretical and empirical research suggests that kinship influences the development and maintenance of social bonds among group-living female mammals, and that human females may be unusual in the extent to which individuals form differentiated social relationships with nonrelatives. Here we combine behavioral observations of party association, spatial proximity, grooming, and space use with extensive molecular genetic analyses to determine whether female chimpanzees form strong social bonds with unrelated individuals of the same sex. We compare our results with those obtained from male chimpanzees who live in the same community and have been shown to form strong social bonds with each other. We demonstrate that party association is as good a predictor of spatial proximity and grooming in females as it is in males, that the highest party association indices are consistently found between female dyads, that the sexes do not differ in the long-term stability of their party association patterns, and that these results cannot be explained as a by-product of the tendency of females to selectively range in particular areas of the territory. We also show that close kin (i.e. mother–daughter and sibling dyads) are very rare, indicating that the vast majority of female dyads that form strong social bonds are not closely related. Additional analyses reveal that “subgroups” of females, consisting of individuals who frequently associate with one another in similar areas of the territory, do not consist of relatives. This suggests that a passive form of kin-biased dispersal, involving the differential migration of females from neighboring communities into subgroups, was also unlikely to be occurring. These results show that, as in males, kinship plays a limited role in structuring the intrasexual social relationships of female chimpanzees. Am. J.

Aggressive interactions can be costly on an energetic level, demanding increased energy or causing injuries, and on a psychological level, in the form of increased anxiety and damaged relationships between opponents. Here we used urinary glucocorticoid (uGC) levels to assess the costs of aggression in wild chimpanzees of Budongo Forest, Uganda. We collected 169 urine samples from nine adult male chimpanzees following 14 aggressive interactions (test condition) and 10 resting events (control condition). Subjects showed significantly higher uGC levels after single aggressive interactions compared to control conditions, likely for aggressors as well as victims. Higher ranking males had greater increases of uGC levels after aggression than lower ranking males. In contrast, uGC levels showed no significant change in relation to aggression length or intensity, indicating that psychological factors might have played a larger role than mere energetic expenditure. We concluded that aggressive behaviour is costly for both aggressors and victims and that costs seem poorly explained by energetic demands of the interaction. Our findings are relevant for studies of post-conflict interactions, since we provide evidence that both aggressors and victims experience a stress response to conflict.},

Male neuroanatomy emphasizes subcortical brain areas and visual-spatial skills whereas that of females emphasizes the neocortex and social cognitive areas. In primate species with high degrees of male competition, areas of the brain dealing with aggression are emphasized. Females have higher mirror neuron activity scores than males. Hundreds of genes differ in expression profiles between males and females. Sexually selected differences in gene expression can produce neuroanatomical sex differences. A feedback system links genes, gene expression, hormones, morphology, social structure and behavior. Sex differences, often through female choice, can be rapidly modulated by socialization. Human evolution is a dramatic case of how a trend toward pair bonding and monogamy lowered male competition and increased female choice as a necessary step in releasing the cognitive potential of our species.},

To understand whether climate has a direct impact on activity, and determine whether vervet monkeys have the behavioral flexibility to respond to environmental change, we examined whether the amount of time spent resting and feeding in the nonmating and mating seasons were predicted by the thermal and energetic constraints of ambient temperature. Our results show that high temperatures during the nonmating season were associated with an increase in time spent resting, at the expense of feeding. Cold temperatures during the nonmating season were associated with an increase in time spent feeding, at the expense of resting. In contrast, both feeding and resting time during the mating season were independent of temperature, suggesting that animals were not adjusting their activity in relation to temperature during this period. Our data indicate that climate has a direct effect on animal activity, and that animals may be thermally and energetically compromised in the mating season. Our study animals appear to have the behavioral flexibility to tolerate current environmental variability. However, future climate change scenarios predict that the time an animal has available for behaviors critical for survival will be constrained by temperature. Further investigations, aimed at determining the degree of behavioral and physiological flexibility displayed by primates, are needed if we are to fully understand the consequences of environmental change on their distribution and survival.

One has focused on phylogenetic analyses that treat social traits as static, species-specific characteristics; the other has focused on understanding the behavioral flexibility of particular populations or species in response to local ecological or demographic variables. Here, we combine these approaches by distinguishing between constraining traits such as dispersal regimes (male, female, or bi-sexual), which are relatively invariant, and responding traits such as grouping patterns (stable, fission-fusion, sometimes fission-fusion), which can reflect rapid adjustments to current conditions. Using long-term and cross-sectional data from 29 studies of 22 species of wild primates, we confirm that dispersal regime exhibits a strong phylogenetic signal in our sample. We then show that primate species with high variation in group size and adult sex ratios exhibit variability in grouping pattern (i.e., sometimes fission-fusion) with dispersal regime constraining the grouping response. When assessing demographic variation, we found a strong positive relationship between the variability in group size over time and the number of observation years, which further illustrates the importance of long-term demographic data to interpretations of social behavior. Our approach complements other comparative efforts to understand the role of behavioral flexibility by distinguishing between constraining and responding traits, and incorporating these distinctions into analyses of social states over evolutionary and ecological time.},

This raises the question of whether human dimorphism and patterns of male violence are inherited from a common ancestor with chimpanzees or are uniquely derived. Here I review patterns of, and causal models for, dimorphism in humans and other primates. While dimorphism in primates is associated with agonistic male mate competition, a variety of factors can affect male and female size, and thereby dimorphism. The causes of human sexual size dimorphism are uncertain, and could involve several non-mutually-exclusive mechanisms, such as mate competition, resource competition, intergroup violence, and female choice. A phylogenetic reconstruction of the evolution of dimorphism, including fossil hominins, indicates that the modern human condition is derived. This suggests that at least some behavioral similarities with Pan associated with dimorphism may have arisen independently, and not directly from a common ancestor.},

This creates a potential problem as data are often compiled from studies conducted by multiple researchers, whose methods may differ, resulting in variation in data quality. In this article, we investigate the quality of data employed in studies of primate group size. Several issues concerning data quality arise when assembling data on group size. For example, data quality may be compromised if group sizes are estimated from censuses, unhabituated groups, or groups with unrecognized individuals. To mitigate these and other data quality issues, we gathered data from the literature on 23 monkeys and apes using well-defined and biologically relevant criteria for inclusion. We compare our results with those of eight published compilations of group size. Most studies did not provide details regarding the criteria for including data. We found that our group size values were uncorrelated or weakly correlated with those from three other studies and differed in a consistent fashion from those of one other study. Because conclusions derived from comparative analyses are only as accurate as the data that they use, future studies should provide details regarding data collection to ensure their reliability.},

Connectivity patterns result from interactions between dispersers and the environment. However, connectivity assessments often ignore responses of dispersers to matrix types or characterize matrix resistance using habitat-use, rather than movement, data. We compare conservation rankings for connectivity of forest fragments in Garo Hills, India, where matrix resistance was quantified based on (a) distance among fragments, (b) habitat use, and (c) movement constraints for the arboreal western hoolock gibbon Hoolock hoolock. We first quantified matrix resistance based on gibbon movement, in terms of gap-crossing behavior, as a function of canopy gap and tree height, which was estimated using focal scans on seven gibbon groups. Second, we estimated matrix resistance based on gibbon habitat use of major land-use types in the study landscape. We then compared rankings of forest fragments using patch connectivity indices from network analyses using these quantified matrix resistances and Euclidean distance among sites. We found that matrix resistances based on movement data suggested greater resistance of plantations than did habitat-use data. Conservation rankings based on movement data were uncorrelated with those based on Euclidean distance. Rankings derived from movement data were correlated with those obtained from location data; however, there were several discrepancies between rankings, which were explained by landscape heterogeneity in the neighborhood of fragments. Incorporating movement behavior into connectivity assessments can improve our understanding of dispersal and provide a mechanistic basis for conservation prioritization in heterogeneous landscapes.},

In stable hierarchies, such males have distinctive secretory profiles of glucocorticoids and of testosterone. We find that these endocrine features are not, in fact, purely markers of social dominance; instead, they are found only among dominant males with particular stylistic traits of social behavior. One intercorrelated stylistic cluster revolved around the intensity with which the male is involved in sexual consortships (e.g., frequency of copulation, of grooming, degree to which feeding is suppressed by being in consortship). Males most involved in such consortships had the lowest basal cortisol concentrations and smaller cortisol stress-responses. A second stylistic cluster revolved around the degree of social affiliation (e.g., rate of grooming and interacting positively with non-estrus females and infants). Males who were highly affiliated had low basal cortisol concentrations and an attenuated cortisol stress-response. A third cluster revolved around the degree to which males could distinguish between highly threatening interactions with rivals and neutral or mildly threatening ones. Males most adept at this had lower basal cortisol concentrations. These behavioral/endocrine clusters were independent of each other. This suggests that the same adaptive physiological feature (e.g., low basal cortisol concentrations) may arise from different and independent personality styles. © 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {We have studied the relationship between dominance rank and physiology among male olive baboons (Papio anubis) living freely in a national park in Africa. In stable hierarchies, dominant males consistently have lower basal concentrations than do subordinates of the adrenal glucocorticoid cortisol. Because of the known catabolic actions of glucocorticoids, dominant males may be less at risk for some of the pathogenic consequences of glucocorticoid overexposure. We find that low basal cortisol concentration is not, in fact, a marker of social dominance; instead, it is only found among dominant males with a certain style of dominance. Lower basal cortisol concentrations occurred among males with any of the following behaviors: the most marked ability to distinguish between threatening and merely neutral interactions with rivals and, if the former, the greatest likelihood of initiating a fight; the most skill at distinguishing between winning and losing a fight and, if the latter, the greatest likelihood of displacing aggression onto a third party. Collectively, these behaviors suggest high degrees of social skillfulness, control, and predictability over social contingencies, all recognized as psychological features that minimize the pathophysiological impact of stress. Dominant males lacking these behavioral features, in contrast, had as high cortisol concentrations as did subordinate males. Finally, low basal cortisol concentrations were also a feature of males with the longest tenures in the dominant cohort, suggesting that this endocrine dichotomy is meaningful in terms of life histories.},

	abstract = {In an ongoing study of endocrine function in wild olive baboons living freely in Kenya, sustained social stress was associated with suppressed testosterone (T) concentrations in males. In the present report, the acute stressor of rapid capture and immobilization caused profound and rapid suppression of T concentrations in these individuals. Elevation of cortisol concentrations preceded, and was at least partially responsible for, the declining T concentrations, as dexamethasone (DEX) administration produced a similar suppression. DEX inhibited T secretion, but did not alter its clearance. The testes appeared to be the principal site of this inhibition; DEX did not alter LHRHinduced pituitary secretion of LH, somewhat attenuated LH bioactivity, but caused a complete suppression of LH-induced testicular secretion of T. Considerable individual variation occurred in sensitivity to stress-induced suppression of T concentrations. Some individuals had transient elevations of T concentrations during the poststress hour, although concentrations ultimately declined significantly. These males were also least sensitive to DEX inhibition of LH-induced T secretion. These studies demonstrate acute stress-induced suppression of gonadal function in a population of primates living in their natural habitat. Furthermore, they implicate glucocorticoid actions mostly at the testes as possible underlying endocrine mechanisms for such regulation. (Endocrinology 116: 2273-2278,1985)},

	abstract = {Cope’s rule proposes that animal lineages evolve toward larger body size over time. To test this hypothesis across all marine animals, we compiled a data set of body sizes for 17,208 genera of marine animals spanning the past 542 million years. Mean biovolume across genera has increased by a factor of 150 since the Cambrian, whereas minimum biovolume has decreased by less than a factor of 10, and maximum biovolume has increased by more than a factor of 100,000. Neutral drift from a small initial value cannot explain this pattern. Instead, most of the size increase reflects differential diversification across classes, indicating that the pattern does not reflect a simple scaling-up of widespread and persistent selection for larger size within populations.
Getting bigger all the time
In today's world, many animal species are large, with even larger species only recently extinct, but the first animals to evolve were tiny. Was this increase in size due to active selection or to some more random process? Heim et al. test the classic hypothesis known as Cope's rule, which posits that there is selection for increasing body size. They analyzed a data set that spans over 500 million years and includes more than 17,000 marine animal species. In support of Cope's rule, body volumes have increased by over five orders of magnitude since the first animals evolved. Furthermore, modeling suggests that such a massive increase could not have emerged from a random process.

Although it is well known that ancestry inferences using mtDNA haplogroups and those using genome-wide markers are frequently discrepant, little empirical information exists on the magnitude and scope of such discrepancies between multiple mtDNA haplogroups and worldwide populations. We compared genetic-ancestry inferences made by mtDNA-haplogroup membership to those made by autosomal SNPs in ∼940 samples of the Human Genome Diversity Panel and recently admixed populations from the 1000 Genomes Project. Continental-ancestry proportions often varied widely among individuals sharing the same mtDNA haplogroup. For only half of mtDNA haplogroups did the highest average continental-ancestry proportion match the highest continental-ancestry proportion of a majority of individuals with that haplogroup. Prediction of an individual’s mtDNA haplogroup from his or her continental-ancestry proportions was often incorrect. Collectively, these results indicate that for most individuals in the worldwide populations sampled, mtDNA-haplogroup membership provides limited information about either continental ancestry or continental region of origin.},

	abstract = {Multiple factors, including climate change, dispersal barriers, and social behavior influence the genetic structure of natural populations. While the effects of extrinsic factors such as historical climatic change and habitat topography have been well studied, mostly in temperate habitats, the simultaneous effects of intrinsic factors such as social behavior on genetic structure have rarely been explored. Such simultaneous effect, however, may particularly be common in social mammals such as many primates. Consequently, we studied the population structure of a rare and endangered social primate, the Arunachal macaque Macaca munzala, endemic to the northeastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, located on the subtropical southern edge of the Tibetan Plateau and forming part of the Eastern Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. We studied a 534 bp-long mitochondrial DNA sequence and 22 autosomal microsatellite loci in individuals from three populations, Tawang, Upper Subansiri, and West Siang. The mtDNA data revealed three major divergence events: that between the Arunachal and bonnet macaques (ca. 1.61 mya), the founding of the West Siang population and the ancestral population of the present-day bonnet macaques (ca. 1.32 mya), and the divergence between the Tawang and Upper Subansiri populations (ca. 0.80 mya) that coincided with the major glacial events in the region. Comparing mitochondrial DNA with autosomal microsatellites, we also found evidence for female philopatry and male-driven long-distance gene flow. Arunachal macaques thus appear to be characterized by groups of philopatric females separated by geographical barriers and harsh climate but with dispersing males exerting a homogenizing effect on the nuclear gene pool. Given that severe population differentiation is of major concern in species conservation, we suggest that our study populations represent significant conservation units of this rare, endangered primate but, more importantly, emphasize the complex interplay of extrinsic and intrinsic factors in shaping the population structure of a social mammalian species.

	abstract = {* Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) are widely used to quantify concentrations of hormone metabolites. Modifications in laboratory conditions may affect the accuracy of metabolite concentration measurements and lead to misinterpretations when results of different accuracy are combined for a statistical analysis. This issue is of great relevance to studies in behavioural and evolutionary ecology because these usually aim at understanding how hormone concentrations vary between individuals, environments or experimental conditions.


* We present a method based on re-assaying a subset of samples to standardize hormone metabolite concentrations when changes in EIA accuracy occur. We used glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations (fGMCs) measured in faeces of spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) between 2011 and 2013 with a previously validated EIA. Changes in accuracy were assessed by monitoring the metabolite concentration of faecal control ‘pools’ that were systematically assayed with faecal samples. A cluster analysis on these pools identified two distinct sample sets with different EIA accuracy; ‘Cluster 1’ and ‘Cluster 2’. We then re-assayed all samples of Cluster 1 (n = 138) with an EIA accuracy similar to that of Cluster 2 and fitted a linear regression to the remeasured fGMCs against the initial fGMCs to predict fGMCs in Cluster 2. To determine the minimum number of samples to re-assay that allows reliable predictions, we assessed the variation in the quality of model predictions by fitting linear regressions on decreasing numbers of re-assayed samples. This revealed that re-assaying 27 samples would be sufficient to generate reliable predictions considering our data set.


* To test the robustness of our method, we fitted a new linear regression to 27 randomly chosen samples and used its equation to standardize all fGMCs of Cluster 1. The standardized fGMCs were similar to the remeasured fGMCs, and the regression on 27 samples was as effective at standardizing fGMCs as the regression fitted on the complete data set.


* Our standardization method permits the combination of results of different accuracy. It is a simple and reliable alternative to the costly, time-consuming and often impractical re-assaying of complete sample sets that can be applied to a wide variety of species and sample types.},

	abstract = {Studies of personality in nonhuman primates have usually relied on assessments by humans and seldom considered the function of the resulting “trait” classifications. In contrast, we applied exploratory principal component analysis to seven behaviors among 45 wild female baboons over 7 y to determine whether the personality dimensions that emerged were associated with measures of reproductive success. We identified three relatively stable personality dimensions, each characterized by a distinct suite of behaviors that were not redundant with dominance rank or the availability of kin. Females scoring high on the “Nice” dimension were friendly to all females and often grunted to lower-ranking females to signal benign intent. “Aloof” females were aggressive, less friendly, and grunted primarily to higher-ranking females. “Loner” females were often alone, relatively unfriendly, and also grunted most often to higher-ranking females. Aloof and Loner females were rarely approached by others. Personality dimensions were correlated in different ways with three measures previously shown to be associated with fitness: stress levels and two behavioral indices reflecting the closeness of dyadic bonds formed by individuals. Females who scored high on Nice had high composite sociality indices (CSI) and stable partner preferences, whereas females who scored high on Aloof had lower CSI scores but significantly more stable partner preferences. Loner females had significantly lower CSI scores, less stable partner preferences, and significantly higher glucocorticoid levels. It remains to be determined which of the Nice or Aloof personality dimensions is more adaptive, or whether variation is maintained by contrasting effects on fitness.},

	abstract = {The challenge hypothesis posits a correlation between male androgen levels and mating system, male–male aggression in a sexual context, and parental effort. This model has received support across a variety of taxa, including primates. Most primate studies have focused on multi-male societies characterized by relatively high levels of male–male aggression and limited paternal care. To expand this dataset, predictions of the challenge hypothesis were tested in a population of wild siamangs (Symphalangus syndactylus), small apes characterized by intense territoriality, monogamous/polyandrous grouping patterns, and varying amounts of paternal behavior. Behavioral data were collected on 11 study groups (five two-male groups and six one-male groups). Seven hundred thirty-four fecal samples were collected from 18 adult males to quantify concentrations of fecal immunoreactive androgens (fiA) by radioimmunoassay. As predicted by the challenge hypothesis, males involved in the aggressive replacement of a resident male had significantly higher fiA concentrations than control males, while males displaying active parental care had significantly lower fiA concentrations than average. Results showed no association between male androgen concentration and group composition, male rank, or rate of intragroup male–male aggression. These latter findings, seemingly inconsistent with the hypothesis, could be explained by the clear and stable dominance relationships between co-resident males: given the very low rates of physical aggression, a low baseline testosterone is to be expected. Furthermore, the effects of increased intragroup conflict experienced by males in two-male groups might be offset by the higher frequency of intergroup aggression experienced by males in one-male groups.},

	abstract = {Sexual selection theory predicts that males in polygynous species of mammals will invest more reproductive effort in mate competition than parental investment. A corollary to this prediction is that males will mount a stress response when their access to mates is threatened. Indeed, numerous studies have shown that males exhibit elevated stress hormones, or glucocorticoids (GCs), when their access to females, or a proxy to this access like dominance rank, is challenged. In contrast, the relationship between stress hormones and paternal effort is less obvious. We report results from a study of wild male chacma baboons indicating that males experienced elevated GC levels during periods of social instability following the immigration of a dominant male. These effects were strongest in males whose mating opportunities were at greatest risk: high-ranking males and males engaged in sexual consortships. Males involved in friendships with lactating females, a form of paternal investment, also experienced high GC levels during these periods of instability. There was a tendency for males with lactating female friends to reduce their time spent in consortships during unstable periods, when the risk of infanticide was high. Thus, even in a highly polygynous mammal, males may have to balance paternal effort with mating effort. Males who invest entirely in mating effort risk losing the infants they have sired to infanticide. Males who invest in paternal care may enhance their offspring’s survival, but at the cost of elevated GC levels, the risk of injury, and the loss of mating opportunities.},

	abstract = {To understand the evolution of acoustic communication in animals, it is important to distinguish between the structure and the usage of vocal signals, since both aspects are subject to different constraints. In terrestrial mammals, the structure of calls is largely innate, while individuals have a greater ability to actively initiate or withhold calls. In closely related taxa, one would therefore predict a higher flexibility in call usage compared to call structure. In the present study, we investigated the vocal repertoire of free living Guinea baboons (Papio papio) and examined the structure and usage of the animals’ vocal signals. Guinea baboons live in a complex multi-level social organization and exhibit a largely tolerant and affiliative social style, contrary to most other baboon taxa. To classify the vocal repertoire of male and female Guinea baboons, cluster analyses were used and focal observations were conducted to assess the usage of vocal signals in the particular contexts.

In contrast, observations of accentuated dimorphism in certain taxa and in large species are consistent with nonadaptive explanations for the evolution of sexual size dimorphism based on phylogenetic inertia and allometry. Here we employ a weight-corrected measure of sexual dimorphism and a biologically realistic assay of mating competition, the operational sex ratio, to reexamine the factors favoring the evolution of sexual size dimorphism in primates. Independent contrasts that control for the effects of allometry and phylogeny produce results consistent with the sexual selection hypothesis; a strong relationship exists between sexual dimorphism in size and the intensity of male mating competition among polygynously mating primates. Increased sexual dimorphism in large primates may not be an inevitable consequence of allometry but instead may result from a reduction in the temporal availability of fertile females due to long birth intervals.},

Numerous bird studies support this idea, but few tests have been conducted with primates. We conducted behavioural observations and noninvasive hormone sampling of 11 male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, in the Kanyawara study site, Kibale National Park, to test predictions of the challenge hypothesis. Results indicated that adult male chimpanzees showed significant testosterone  increases during periods when parous females showed maximally tumescent sexual swellings. These periods were also marked by increased rates of male aggression. Male testosterone levels did not increase in the presence of maximally tumescent nulliparous females. Such females are less attractive to males: they are not mate-guarded, nor do rates of male aggression increase when they are swelling. Male chimpanzees copulate with parous and nulliparous females at similar rates, however, suggesting that testosterone increases in the presence of cycling parous females are associated with aggression rather than sexual behaviour. High-ranking chimpanzees were more aggressive than low-ranking males and produced higher levels of urinary testosterone. Thus, the predictions of the challenge hypothesis were generally upheld. This suggests that the hypothesis may have wider applicability among primates, including humans.},

	abstract = {Despite significant advances in our knowledge of how testosterone mediates life-history trade-offs, this research has primarily focused on seasonal taxa. We know comparatively little about the relationship between testosterone and life-history stages for non-seasonally breeding species. Here we examine testosterone profiles across the life span of males from three non-seasonally breeding primates: yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus or P. hamadryas cynocephalus), chacma baboons (Papio ursinus or P. h. ursinus), and geladas (Theropithecus gelada). First, we predict that testosterone profiles will track the reproductive profiles of each taxon across their respective breeding years. Second, we evaluate age-related changes in testosterone to determine whether several life-history transitions are associated with these changes. Subjects include males ({\textgreater}2.5 years) from wild populations of each taxon from whom we had fecal samples for hormone determination. Although testosterone profiles across taxa were broadly similar, considerable variability was found in the timing of two major changes: (1) the attainment of adult levels of testosterone and (2) the decline in testosterone after the period of maximum production. Attainment of adult testosterone levels was delayed by 1 year in chacmas compared with yellows and geladas. With respect to the decline in testosterone, geladas and chacmas exhibited a significant drop after 3 years of maximum production, while yellows declined so gradually that no significant annual drop was ever detected. For both yellows and chacmas, increases in testosterone production preceded elevations in social dominance rank. We discuss these differences in the context of ecological and behavioral differences exhibited by these taxa.},

	abstract = {The secretion of glucocorticoids (GCs) is a classic endocrine response to stress. Despite that, it remains controversial as to what purpose GCs serve at such times. One view, stretching back to the time of Hans Selye, posits that GCs help mediate the ongoing or pending stress response, either via basal levels of GCs permitting other facets of the stress response to emerge efficaciously, and/or by stress levels of GCs actively stimulating the stress response. In contrast, a revisionist viewpoint posits that GCs suppress the stress response, preventing it from being pathologically overactivated. In this review, we consider recent findings regarding GC action and, based on them, generate criteria for determining whether a particular GC action permits, stimulates, or suppresses an ongoing stress-response or, as an additional category, is preparative for a subsequent stressor. We apply these GC actions to the realms of cardiovascular function, fluid volume and hemorrhage, immunity and inflammation, metabolism, neurobiology, and reproductive physiology. We find that GC actions fall into markedly different categories, depending on the physiological endpoint in question, with evidence for mediating effects in some cases, and suppressive or preparative in others. We then attempt to assimilate these heterogeneous GC actions into a physiological whole.},

Many organisms have become extinct in the last century, but habitat destruction, disease and man-made factors other than climate change have been implicated as the causal factor in almost all of these. Reproduction is certain to be negatively impacted in all vertebrate groups for a variety of reasons, such as direct thermal and hydric effects on mortality of embryos, mismatches between optimal availability of food supplies, frequently determined by temperature, and reproductive capacities, sometimes determined by rigid factors such as photoperiod, and disappearance of appropriate foraging opportunities, such as melting sea ice. The numbers of studies documenting correlations between climate changes and biological phenomena are rapidly increasing, but more direct information about the consequences of these changes for species survival and ecosystem health is needed than is currently available.},

Here, we use machine learning models to identify correlates of extinction risk in African terrestrial mammals using a set of variables belonging to four classes: species distribution state, human pressures, conservation response and species biology. We derived information on distribution state and human pressure from satellite-borne imagery. Variables in all four classes were identified as important predictors of extinction risk, and interactions were observed among variables in different classes (e.g. level of protection, human threats, species distribution ranges). Species biology had a key role in mediating the effect of external variables. The model was 90\% accurate in classifying extinction risk status of species, but in a few cases the observed and modelled extinction risk mismatched. Species in this condition might suffer from an incorrect classification of extinction risk (hence require reassessment). An increased availability of satellite imagery combined with improved resolution and classification accuracy of the resulting maps will play a progressively greater role in conservation monitoring.},

	abstract = {Background
In communal mammals the levels of social interaction among group members vary considerably. In recent years, biologists have realized that within-group interactions may affect survival of the group members. Several recent studies have demonstrated that the social integration of adult females is positively associated with infant survival, and female longevity is affected by the strength and stability of the individual social bonds. Our aim was to determine the social factors that influence adult longevity in social mammals. 
         
         
           Methodology/Principal Findings 
           As a model system, we studied the social rock hyrax ( Procavia capensis ), a plural breeder with low reproductive skew, whose groups are mainly composed of females. We applied network theory using 11 years of behavioral data to quantify the centrality of individuals within groups, and found adult longevity to be inversely correlated to the variance in centrality. In other words, animals in groups with more equal associations lived longer. Individual centrality was not correlated with longevity, implying that social tension may affect all group members and not only the weakest or less connected ones. 
         
         
           Conclusions/Significance 
           Our novel findings support previous studies emphasizing the adaptive value of social associations and the consequences of inequality among adults within social groups. However, contrary to previous studies, we suggest that it is not the number or strength of associations that an adult individual has (i.e. centrality) that is important, but the overall configuration of social relationships within the group (i.e. centrality SD) that is a key factor in influencing longevity.},

Here, we create a set of life-history models for species whose coalitionary behavior is genetically determined to investigate how different types of costs afflicted upon members of failed coalitions, in terms of survival, fecundity, and social rank, may influence the nature of coalitionary behavior that emerges at evolutionary equilibrium. We also extend previous theory by examining the coevolution between coalitionary behavior and concessions granted by dominant individuals to prevent dominants from being targeted by coalitions. We show that species that form coalitions to contest social rank evolve to regularly form bridging coalitions under a vast majority of social and ecological settings, whereas species that contest fecundity form all-up coalitions under most conditions. Further, dominant individuals concede resources to subordinates to prevent coalitionary attacks only in very few circumstances, and these concessions occur only to ensure another individual is a more attractive coalition target. We compare and contrast results to empirical data to provide an evolutionary context for commonly observed coalitionary behaviors in the animal kingdom.},

We still know little, however, about how females' relationships are structured within the social group, or whether connections beyond the level of the dyad have any adaptive value. Here, we apply social network analysis to wild baboons in order to evaluate the comparative benefits of dyadic bonds against several network measures. Results suggest that females with strong dyadic bonds also showed high eigenvector centrality, a measure of the extent to which an individual's partners are connected to others in the network. Eigenvector centrality was a better predictor of offspring survival than dyadic bond strength. Previous results have shown that female baboons derive significant fitness benefits from forming close, stable bonds with several other females. Results presented here suggest that these benefits may be further augmented if a female's social partners are themselves well connected to others within the group rather than being restricted to a smaller clique.},

	abstract = {Adult female and male impala engage in a type of allogrooming in which partners alternately deliver bouts of oral grooming to the head and neck. These grooming encounters comprise typically six to 12 tit-for-tat-like exchanges of bouts and are highly reciprocal among adult females, adult bachelor males and subadult males. Although allogrooming among females could be between related individuals, that occurring among adult males would appear to be between unrelated individuals. Unlike allogrooming reported for some primate species and other ungulates, the dominant impala received no more grooming than the subordinate. It is proposed that one function of impala allogrooming is to reduce the ectoparasite load on body areas an animal cannot reach with its own mouth. The impala reciprocal allogrooming system is unique among free-ranging antelope and other ungulates and may be a candidate for the tit-fortat strategy of evolved cooperation.},

Here, we test for general correlates of allomaternal care in a broad sample of 445 mammal species, by examining life history traits, brain size, and different helping behaviors, such as provisioning, carrying, huddling or protecting the offspring and the mother. As predicted from an energetic-cost perspective, a positive correlation between brain size and the amount of help by non-mothers is found among mammalian clades as a whole and within most groups, especially carnivores, with the notable exception of primates. In the latter group, the presence of energy subsidies during breeding instead resulted in increased fertility, up to the extreme of twinning in callitrichids, as well as a more altricial state at birth. In conclusion, humans exhibit a combination of the pattern found in provisioning carnivores, and the enhanced fertility shown by cooperatively breeding primates. Our comparative results provide support for the notion that cooperative breeding allowed early humans to sidestep the generally existing trade-off between brain size and reproductive output, and suggest an alternative explanation to the controversial ‘obstetrical dilemma’-argument for the relatively altricial state of human neonates at birth.},

	abstract = {Ecological conditions are expected to have an important influence on individuals’ investment in cooperative care. However, the nature of their effects is unclear: both favorable and unfavorable conditions have been found to promote helping behavior. Recent studies provide a possible explanation for these conflicting results by suggesting that increased ecological variability, rather than changes in mean conditions, promote cooperative care. However, no study has tested whether increased ecological variability promotes individual-level helping behavior or the mechanisms involved. We test this hypothesis in a long-term study population of the cooperatively breeding banded mongoose, Mungos mungo, using 14 years of behavioral and meteorological data to explore how the mean and variability of ecological conditions influence individual behavior, body condition, and survival. Female body condition was more sensitive to changes in rainfall leading to poorer female survival and pronounced male-biased group compositions after periods of high rainfall variability. After such periods, older males invested more in helping behavior, potentially because they had fewer mating opportunities. These results provide the first empirical evidence for increased individual helping effort in more variable ecological conditions and suggest this arises because of individual differences in the effect of ecological conditions on body condition and survival, and the knock-on effect on social group composition. Individual differences in sensitivity to environmental variability, and the impacts this has on the internal structure and composition of animal groups, can exert a strong influence on the evolution and maintenance of social behaviors, such as cooperative care.},

The patterns of these associations can be relatively stable across time. Here we investigate whether dyadic social relationships between the sexes transcend mere association in wild Assamese macaques and may be characterized as strong, equitable, and stable affiliative relationships or social bonds. We collected {\textgreater}9,000 hr of focal animal data on adult males and females from two groups of wild Assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis) at Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand. Using dyadic composite sociality indices, we found male–female affiliative relationships to be highly differentiated. The stronger the relationships were, the more likely partners were to reciprocate grooming and the more stable were the relationships. In addition, the strongest dyadic relationships remained stable over multiple years as long as both partners remained in the group. These results indicate that in a polygynous species particular males and females form strong, equitable, and enduring affiliative relationships qualitatively similar to the same-sex bonds described for female baboons and male chimpanzees.

Among large-bodied mammals, prolonged lactation and infant dependence suggest particularly strong potential for a quality–quantity trade-off to exist. Humans are one of the only such species to have been examined, providing mixed evidence under a peculiar set of circumstances, including extensive nutritional provisioning by nonmothers and extrasomatic wealth transmission. Here, we examine trade-offs between reproductive rate and one aspect of offspring quality (body size) in wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii), a species with long periods of infant dependence and little direct provisioning. Juvenile lean body mass, estimated using urinary creatinine excretion, was positively associated with the interval to the next sibling’s birth. These effects persisted into adolescence and were not moderated by maternal identity. Maternal depletion could not explain poor offspring growth, as older mothers had larger offspring, and low maternal energy balance during lactation predicted larger, not smaller, juvenile size. Instead, our data suggest that offspring growth suffers when mothers wean early to invest in new reproductive efforts. These findings indicate that chimpanzee mothers with the resources to do so prioritize production of new offspring over prolonged investment in current offspring.},

Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the ‘gold standard’ for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

But by what mechanisms does humanity drive the emergence of new species? We review human-mediated speciation, compare speciation and known extinctions, and discuss the challenges of using net species diversity as a conservation objective. Humans drive rapid evolution through relocation, domestication, hunting and novel ecosystem creation—and emerging technologies could eventually provide additional mechanisms. The number of species relocated, domesticated and hunted during the Holocene is of comparable magnitude to the number of observed extinctions. While instances of human-mediated speciation are known, the overall effect these mechanisms have upon speciation rates has not yet been quantified. We also explore the importance of anthropogenic influence upon divergence in microorganisms. Even if human activities resulted in no net loss of species diversity by balancing speciation and extinction rates, this would probably be deemed unacceptable. We discuss why, based upon ‘no net loss’ conservation literature—considering phylogenetic diversity and other metrics, risk aversion, taboo trade-offs and spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that evaluating speciation alongside extinction could result in more nuanced understanding of biosphere trends, clarifying what it is we actually value about biodiversity.},

	abstract = {The endocrine mechanisms causing variation and plasticity in life history traits (e.g., development time, mass at birth/hatching, rate of postnatal growth, age or size at sexual maturity, litter or clutch size, annual survival, and lifespan) or fitness (annual or lifetime reproductive success) have recently garnered considerable interest. We review three issues facing studies that quantify relationships between endocrine traits and life histories or measures of fitness and describe possible solutions using insights from evolutionary ecology. We focus in particular on the steroid hormones glucocorticoids that are involved in the vertebrate neuroendocrine stress response. First, context-dependent associations between endocrine traits and life histories or fitness are widespread, and therefore, it is important to quantify how intrinsic or extrinsic factors modify these relationships. Second, studies in evolutionary endocrinology may aspire to quantify patterns of natural selection on endocrine traits, but this may not tell us how they influence fitness. Studies that also identify the actual targets of selection that the endocrine traits are influencing will be very useful. Third, environmental or intrinsic factors can cause co-variance between endocrine traits and life histories or fitness. This is problematic for interpreting the potential evolutionary consequences of selection on endocrine traits, but it can also produce divergent answers for relationships between endocrine traits and life histories or fitness depending upon whether the data are analyzed in an among- or within-year framework. Future long-term studies following uniquely marked individuals over their lifetime (longitudinal individual-based approach) in combination with experimental manipulations of the endocrine traits or environmental factors influencing both endocrine traits and life histories or fitness may help to produce new insights in evolutionary endocrinology despite these issues. This is an ambitious endeavor, and we briefly review some of the key issues facing such long-term studies and experimental manipulations of endocrine traits.},

Here we propose a simple and generally applicable model of social network structure. We consider the emergence of network structure as a result of social inheritance, in which newborns are likely to bond with maternal contacts, and via forming bonds randomly. We compare model output with data from several species, showing that it can generate networks with properties such as those observed in real social systems. Our model demonstrates that important observed properties of social networks, including heritability of network position or assortative associations, can be understood as consequences of social inheritance.},

* This study tested the effects of habitat, phylogenetic and phenotypic trait predictors on species co-occurrence patterns and abundances, with the endemic primates of Madagascar as an empirical system.


* The abundance of 11 primate species was estimated along gradients of elevation, food resource abundance and anthropogenic habitat disturbance at local scales in south-east Madagascar. Community composition was compared to null models to test for phylogenetic and functional structure, and the effects of phylogenetic relatedness of co-occurring species, their trait similarity and environmental variables on species’ abundances were tested using mixed models and quantile regressions.


* Resource abundance was the strongest predictor of community structure. Where food tree abundance was high, closely related species with similar traits dominated communities. High-elevation communities with lower food tree abundance consisted of species that were distantly related and had divergent traits. Closely related species had dissimilar abundances where they co-occurred, partially driven by trait dissimilarity, indicating character displacement.


* By integrating local-scale variation in primate community composition, evolutionary relatedness and functional diversity, this study found strong evidence that community assembly in this system can be explained by competition and character displacement along ecological gradients.},

Social interactions among adult rhesus females of one free-ranging social group on Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico were observed for four consecutive years to determine the extent to which patterns of affiliative interaction met several predictions of three such hypothesized organizing principles: kin-based attractiveness, attraction-to-high-rank and the similarity principle. We employed a multiple regression extension of the Mantel test (Smouse et al., 1986) to test the independent effects of kinship and rank distance on measures of affiliation and reciprocity. Close kin not only engaged in more affiliative behaviour than distant kin (see our companion paper, Kapsalis \& Berman, this volume), they were more likely to support one another in agonistic encounters and to exchange grooming for alliance support and access to drinking water. We found evidence that low-ranking females were attracted to high-ranking females in some years of study, and that grooming by low-ranking females was exchanged with tolerance at a monopolizable resource by high-ranking grooming partners. However, we were unable to test conclusively for the effects of competitive exclusion. Little evidence was found to support the predictions of the similarity principle. We concluded that kin-based attractiveness was probably the primary organizing principle operating in the study group but that elements of attraction-to-high-rank may operate in concert to some extent.},

	abstract = {The yellow-breasted capuchin monkey (Sapajus xanthosternos) is one of the seven Brazilian primates that are currently threatened with extinction. Although the species is known to be threatened by habitat loss, hunting, and illegal pet trade, few data exist on how these threats influence its long-term population persistence. We conducted population viability analyses (PVAs) to estimate minimum viable populations of S. xanthosternos under 10 threat scenarios (i.e., varying hunting pressure and varying number of infants captured for the pet trade) for five forest fragments with different estimated carrying capacities (K). We also estimated the minimum forest fragment size required to sustain viable populations living under the same 10 threat scenarios, based on critical numbers of K obtained in sensitivity tests, below which the population would be unviable. Our PVAs suggests that hunting has a higher impact on population viability in comparison to threats from the pet trade. Annual losses of adult and young females from hunting had the most detrimental effect on population persistence under all forest fragment sizes. Such hunting pressure is not sustainable for populations living in areas ≤3,460 ha, since these areas may not support populations of ≥84 individuals. The seven largest of the 13 protected areas currently harboring capuchins should be effective at maintaining viable populations in the long term even under the greatest threat scenarios we modeled. Other large forest patches, mainly in the western part of the species distribution, are recommended as priority areas for protection to increase the chances of capuchins' survival for the long term. In addition, forest fragments of ≤782.8 ha cannot maintain viable populations, even when there are no threats from hunting or from captures for the pet trade. Increased law enforcement is necessary to prevent the hunting and capture of capuchins, especially within larger forest fragments. Am. J. Primatol. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Studies of kin bias in the distribution of social behaviour in group-living matrifocal species generally underline the importance of bonds among female kin. However, few studies examine either how kin bias may be affected by variation in the availability of kin or the relevance of paternal kin. In this study, we used genetic and behavioural data to analyse correlates of coalition formation, proximity, grooming and dominance relations among female white-faced capuchins over a 10-year period during which the number of adult females in the group varied from 6 to 10. Females sided with the most closely related of two opponents when joining coalitions. Both dominance rank and kinship influenced proximity and grooming patterns. In particular, when group size was small, mean relatedness high and interdyadic variation in relatedness low, rank distance was a better predictor of proximity and grooming than was kinship distance. However, when group size was large, mean relatedness lower and interdyadic variation in relatedness higher, females significantly biased their grooming and spatial proximity towards kin. Dominance rank was not so tightly associated with relatedness as in provisioned female-bonded cercopithecines; females did not follow the ‘youngest sister ascendancy rule’. Full sisters, maternal half sisters and mother–daughter dyads associated at statistically indistinguishable rates, and all associated significantly more often than paternal half sisters. Paternal half sisters did not associate more often than distantly related female–female dyads (r \&lt; 0.125). These and similar results call into question the general importance of paternal kin ties in wild primates.},

Here we test a number of predictions derived from kin selection theory about the strength of social bonds among adult female baboons. Our analyses are based on systematic observations of grooming and association patterns among 118 females living in seven different social groups in the Amboseli Basin of Kenya over a 16-year period. Females in these groups formed the strongest bonds with close kin, including their mothers, daughters, and maternal and paternal sisters. Females were also strongly attracted toward females who were close to their own age, perhaps because peers were often paternal sisters. Females’ bonds with their maternal sisters were strengthened after their mother’s deaths, whereas their relationships with their maternal aunts were weakened after their mother’s death. In addition, females formed stronger bonds with their paternal sisters when no close maternal kin were available, and they compensated for the absence of any close kin by forming strong bonds with nonrelatives. Taken together, these data suggest that social bonds play a vital role in females’ lives, and the ability to establish and maintain strong social bonds may have important fitness consequences for females.},

	abstract = {Male dispersal from the birth group is common in the majority of social mammals, and in many species, males also engage in secondary or breeding dispersal following natal emigration. However, the patterns and causes of secondary dispersal are poorly understood due to the difficulty in following emigrants. Here, we detail the patterns and causation of male secondary dispersal in several groups of white-faced capuchins observed between 1985 and 2000 in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. Subsequent to natal emigration, which occurs between 2 and 8 years of age (median 4.5 years), male white-faced capuchins embark on a life of continual movement. Although males of all age classes engage in voluntary secondary dispersal, the ways by which males enter groups varies according to their age class. Adult males (≥10 years old) are more likely to enter groups aggressively, and they display longer tenure than either subadult males (7–10 years of age) or juvenile males (1–7 years of age). Given our finding that adult males face the highest risks in terms of aggressive interactions with conspecifics, we examined several explanations as to why they continue to disperse throughout their lives. Our data best support the intragroup mating competition hypothesis for secondary dispersal, whereby males move frequently between groups as a means of increasing their reproductive opportunities. Males may also engage in frequent secondary dispersal to avoid mating with their maturing daughters, although this hypothesis was not strongly supported by the current data. Males of all age classes displayed very high levels of parallel dispersal, which probably serves to offset the high costs of dispersal (predation, starvation and/or aggression from conspecifics) and it may also serve as a means of retaining kinship among group males.},

Our study was based on behavioural and demographic data collected on multiple groups of white-faced capuchins in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica since 1985. Here we examine the patterns and proximate causation of male natal dispersal. Natal dispersal in white-faced capuchins occurred at a median age of 4.5 years, with no males remaining in the natal group past 8 years. Initial departure from the natal group appeared to be in response to an attraction to extragroup males and dispersing groupmates. Rates of parallel dispersal (dispersal with co-resident males and/or into groups containing familiar males) were very high for natal males (71–82\%), and this pattern of dispersal may have evolved to increase inclusive fitness benefits in male-dispersed species. Additionally, this pattern of dispersal probably increases survivorship among dispersing males who are not yet physically mature, as is common in white-faced capuchins.},

A total of 604 hr of focal animal data was collected on six adult females in a group of 21 monkeys. Females could be ranked in a stable, linear dominance hierarchy. Adult females spent much more time in proximity to other adult females than to adult males. Females groomed other females twice as often as they groomed males, and about 55 times more often than males groomed males. Females tended to groom up the dominance hierarchy, and dyads with smaller rank distances groomed more often. Higher-ranking females nursed infants other than their own at lower rates than did lower-ranking females; however, females nursed infants of females ranked both above and below them. Although lower-ranking females were more likely than higher-ranking females to be the victims of aggression, higher-ranking females were not necessarily more aggressive than lower-ranking females. In 96\% of female-female coalitions vs. a female, the victim was lower-ranking than both coalition partners; in the remaining 4\%, the victim was intermediate in rank between the two coalition partners. Higher-ranking female-female dyads formed coalitions more often than did lower-ranking dyads. Those female-female dyads that groomed more frequently also formed coalitions more frequently.

Several recent studies found that an individual’s number of affiliative partners positively relates to its probability of survival. Here, we build on these previous results to test how both affiliation and aggression networks predict Barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus) survival in a “natural experiment.” Thirty out of 47 wild Barbary macaques, living in 2 groups, died during an exceptionally cold winter in the Middle Atlas Mountains, Morocco. We analyzed the affiliation and aggression networks of both groups in the 6 months before the occurrences of these deaths, to assess which aspects of their social relationships enhanced individual survivorship. Using only the affiliation network, we found that network clustering was highly predictive of individual survival probability. Using only the aggression network, we found that individual survival probability increased with a higher number of aggression partners and lower clustering coefficient. Interestingly, when both affiliation and aggression networks were considered together, only parameters from the aggression network were included into the best model predicting individual survival. Aggressive relationships might serve to stabilize affiliative social relationships, thereby positively impacting on individual survival during times of extreme weather conditions. Overall, our findings support the view that aggressive social interactions are extremely important for individual well-being and fitness.},

	abstract = {Group living is a source of both costs and benefits for animals. Benefits may include decreased predation risk, and an increased ability to find food and defend clumped resources; the most prominent cost is probably increased competition for food within the group. Presumably, animals will always try to minimize the cost they receive relative to the corresponding benefit. Since costs and benefits will vary between spatial positions within the group, animals should prefer those spatial positions with the lowest costs relative to benefits. For groups whose members are organized by a social dominance hierarchy, access to preferred spatial positions may be a benefit of high rank. We examined the relationship between dominance rank and spatial patterns in two groups of white-faced capuchins,Cebus capucinus. We expected the animals to be faced with two cost–benefit gradients: predation risk increasing from centre to edge, and depletion costs increasing from front to back. Depletion was a significant factor in the dry season but not in the wet season; therefore, presumably only the predation risk gradient was present in the wet season. Dominant animals were more central than their subordinate counterparts during both seasons, and within the centre, they preferred the most forward position during the dry season but not during the wet season. The absence of variation in agonism across spatial positions suggests that active exclusion of subordinates by dominant animals cannot explain the spatial patterns observed. Instead, we conclude that subordinates avoid dominant animals as a strategy to reduce contest competition.},

The book contains papers presented at a symposium on reproductive behavior in insects, held at the 15th International Congress of Entomology in Washington, D.C., in 1976. Organized into 13 chapters, this volume begins with a historical background on sexual selection theory and some of the principal conceptual advances that have been made since Charles Darwin (1871) posited that a sexual character was a characteristic possessed by only one sex and not the other. It then introduces the reader to differences in patterns of sexual selection and how they affect the reproductive success of individuals, male-female mating relationships, and mate choice by females. The book also discusses the evolution of mating strategies in insects, touching on concepts such as parental investment, female choice, and sexual conflict. Later chapters focus on winglessness, fighting, and dimorphism in male fig wasps and other insects, along with agonistic behavior among males of Achias australis, the function of horns in beetles, and the evolution of alternative male reproductive strategies in field crickets. The book also looks into the courtship and mating behavior of insects, and then concludes with an analysis of insect life histories in order to elucidate the biological aspects of the male-female phenomenon. This book is an essential reading for biologists and chemists.},

	abstract = {Many species of Arabian mammals are considered to be of Afrotropical origin and for most of them the Red Sea has constituted an obstacle for dispersal since the Miocene–Pliocene transition. There are two possible routes, the ‘northern’ and the ‘southern’, for terrestrial mammals (including humans) to move between Africa and Arabia. The ‘northern route’, crossing the Sinai Peninsula, is confirmed for several taxa by an extensive fossil record, especially from northern Egypt and the Levant, whereas the ‘southern route’, across the Bab-el-Mandab Strait, which links the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden, is more controversial, although post-Pliocene terrestrial crossings of the Red Sea might have been possible during glacial maxima when sea levels were low.

Hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas) are the only baboon taxon to disperse out of Africa and still inhabit Arabia. In this study, we investigate the origin of Arabian hamadryas baboons using mitochondrial sequence data from 294 samples collected in Arabia and Northeast Africa. Through the analysis of the geographic distribution of genetic diversity, the timing of population expansions, and divergence time estimates combined with palaeoecological data, we test: (i) if Arabian and African hamadryas baboons are genetically distinct; (ii) if Arabian baboons exhibit population substructure; and (iii) when, and via which route, baboons colonized Arabia.

Our results suggest that hamadryas baboons colonized Arabia during the Late Pleistocene (130–12 kya [thousands of years ago]) and also moved back to Africa. We reject the hypothesis that hamadryas baboons were introduced to Arabia by humans, because the initial colonization considerably predates the earliest records of human seafaring in this region. Our results strongly suggest that the ‘southern route’ from Africa to Arabia could have been used by hamadryas baboons during the same time period as proposed for modern humans.},

The neotropical primate, \textit{Cebus capucinus} shares many social patterns with Old World cercopithecines (e.g., female philopatry, male dispersal), which may contribute to similar expression of competitive strategies. To clarify the nature of dominance patterns among female white-faced capuchins we examined hierarchical linearity, rank acquisition, matrilineal rank inheritance, hierarchical strength and stability. We collected focal data on 22 adult females (2008) and long-term dominance data (1986–2008) on 33 adult females in Sector Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. Females displayed linear hierarchies based on the direction of dyadic submission. At sexual maturity females quickly acquired rank positions beneath their mother and older sisters. Hierarchies were considered strong based on high proportions of food-related agonism, short latency to detection of hierarchies (21 h/female) and low directional inconsistency scores (\&lt;5\%). Hierarchies were considered stable based on lack of tied submissive interactions (indicative of uncontested rank positions), low rates of rank change (0.510 changes/year), and long-term stability in matrilineal rank order. These findings enhance our understanding of capuchin social systems and how the competitive strategies of white-faced capuchins compare to those of Old World primates.},

Studies investigating the fitness benefits of close social relationships and the underlying mechanisms have mainly focused on the philopatric sex. The strong relationships of philopatric chimpanzee males and baboon females share important characteristics with human friendships in that increased strength of affiliative relationships is associated with increased equitability in service exchanges and relationship stability. So far, it has remained unclear whether the strong relationships of dispersing males share these characteristics as well and can thus be labelled as social bonds. Here we provide results on the variation in affiliative relationship strength and its relation to equitability and relationship stability from two wild groups of male Assamese macaques, Macaca assamensis, at Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand collected over 2 and 7 years, respectively. Our analyses of almost 9000 h of focal animal data show that males formed differentiated affiliative relationships and that the strength of a relationship affected how likely males returned a grooming service within a single bout and how equally males were responsible for the maintenance of close proximity. Partner stability among the three strongest relationships was higher than among weaker relationships which suggests that top partners were not retained simply because of a lack of alternatives. Together, these results suggest that dispersing male Assamese macaques form differentiated affiliative relationships that increase in equitability and stability with increasing relationship strength. This is the first study showing long-term partner stability in males as the dispersing sex. Our results thus add to the growing body of literature indicating that nonhuman animals form close social relationships similar to human friendships.},

Here, instead we modelled effects of multiple predictors of social network dynamics in the spotted hyena, using observational data collected during 20 years of continuous field research in Kenya. We tested the hypothesis that the current state of the social network affects its long-term dynamics. We employed stochastic agent-based models that allowed us to estimate the contribution of multiple factors to network changes. After controlling for environmental and individual effects, we found that network density and individual centrality affected network dynamics, but that social bond transitivity consistently had the strongest effects. Our results emphasise the significance of structural properties of networks in shaping social dynamics.},

For humans, this requires the recognition of the sociocultural and historical means by which human minds and selves are constructed, and how this gives rise to the reflexivity and ability to respond to novelty that characterize our species. For other, non-linguistic, primates we can answer some interesting questions by viewing social life as a feedback process, drawing on cybernetics and systems approaches and using social network neo-theory to test these ideas. Specifically, we show how social networks can be formalized as multi-dimensional objects, and use entropy measures to assess how networks respond to perturbation. We use simulations and natural ‘knock-outs’ in a free-ranging baboon troop to demonstrate that changes in interactions after social perturbations lead to a more certain social network, in which the outcomes of interactions are easier for members to predict. This new formalization of social networks provides a framework within which to predict network dynamics and evolution, helps us highlight how human and non-human social networks differ and has implications for theories of cognitive evolution.},

	abstract = {The recent application of social network analysis to animal populations has provided a tool to quantify group dynamics and individual social positions, which may enhance our understanding of the costs and benefits of sociality and the evolution of behavioural strategies within societies. Despite this, uncertainties remain about whether comparisons can be drawn between studies in which different sampling techniques have been used. We compared social networks constructed from two interaction and three proximity techniques that are frequently used in the literature, at both the ego network and global network levels, using data collected annually for two troops of chacma baboons, Papio ursinus, over 3 years. We obtained very different results at both the global and individual levels, demonstrating the clear distinction between networks built using different interaction and proximity techniques. While interaction techniques may be comparable at the whole global level, proximity techniques were not, and we found the opposite at the ego network level: proximity techniques could be compared whereas interaction techniques could not. As there was a clear distinction between the networks created, caution should be taken when using proximity as a proxy for social interactions (and vice versa) in social network studies. Further, our results showed high variation between troops and study seasons, reemphasizing the importance of incorporating temporal change in the analysis of social networks. Researchers should consider the effects of sampling technique on the networks produced when comparing networks created from different techniques.},

	abstract = {Advances over the last 15 years have made social network analysis (SNA) a powerful tool for the study of nonhuman primate social behavior. Although many SNA-based techniques have been only very recently adopted in primatological research, others have been commonly used by primatologists for decades. The roots of SNA also stem from some of the same conceptual frameworks as the majority of nonhuman primate behavioral research. The rapid development of SNA in recent years has led to questions within the primatological community of where and how SNA fits within this field. We aim to address these questions by providing an overview of the historical relationship between SNA and the study of nonhuman primates. We begin with a brief history of the development of SNA, followed by a detailed description of the network-based visualization techniques, analytical methods and conceptual frameworks which have been employed by primatologists since as early as the 1960s. We also introduce some of the latest advances to SNA, thereby demonstrating that this approach contains novel tools for the study of nonhuman primate social behavior which may be used to shed light on questions that cannot be addressed fully using more conventional methods.

	abstract = {Under some circumstances dominant females in social groups of primates start to breed significantly earlier in life than do subordinate ones, produce significantly more offspring per year, and mate significantly earlier in the breeding season, if there is one. Thus, competition appears to influence fertility. Observations that dominant individuals sometimes feed on better quality foods, expend less energy or time in obtaining food, or are interrupted less often when feeding, indicate that the effects of competition on fertility could be working through nutrition. In addition, subordinate animals usually suffer more threats and have to avoid others more frequently than do dominants, which may result in ‘stress’ causing lowering of fertility. Whilst ‘stress’ might explain the total suppression of reproduction in subordinate female tamarins in the wild, a correlation between ‘stress’ and fertility has yet to be conclusively demonstrated in wild Old World primates. Evidence that competitive ability might influence a female's rate or timing of copulation is sparse, and nobody has shown that subordinate females mate so infrequently that their fertility is compromised. The situation in which dominant animals are especially likely to produce more offspring than subordinates is seen when resources are so clumped that the dominants can exert their greater competitive ability with sufficient frequency to obtain preferential access to the resources and maybe to influence levels of ‘stress’. The effects of belonging to a large group seem to be very similar to those of being a subordinate, and might operate through the same mechanisms of nutrition and ‘stress’. If so, analysis of the relationship between competitive ability and fertility could be confounded. Whatever the social correlates of variance in fertility, most stages of reproduction appear to be influenced by nutrition and ‘stress’. Finally, in the wild, where mortality rates are often high, a female's reproductive success might be determined more by characteristics that promote survival of offspring than by those that favour production of them.},

Remarkably, however, different studies on this topic have produced contradictory results, with some showing strong positive association between rank and fitness (i.e., dominants gain benefits over subordinates), others weak associations, and some others even revealing negative associations. Here, we investigate dominance-related benefits across primate species while controlling for phylogenetic effects. We extracted data from 94 published studies, representing 25 primate species (2 lemur species, 4 New World monkeys, 16 Old World monkeys, and 3 apes), to assess how dominance affects life-history and behavior. We used standard and phylogenetic meta-analyses to analyze the benefits of dominance in primates. Dominant females had higher infant survival to first year, although we found no significant effect of dominance on female feeding success. Results for female fecundity differed between the two meta-analytical approaches, with no effect of dominance on female fecundity after controlling for phylogeny. Dominant males had a higher fecundity and mating success than subordinate males. Finally, the benefits of dominance for female fecundity were stronger in species with a longer lifespan. Our study supports the view that dominance hierarchies are a key aspect of primate societies as they indeed provide a number of fitness-related benefits to individuals.

	abstract = {Investigations into how climate change shaped human evolution have begun to focus on environmental dynamics, i.e., the nature and tempo of climate and landscape variability, an approach that de-emphasizes static reconstructions of early hominin habitats. The interaction among insolation cycles is especially apparent in the paleoenvironmental records of the East African Rift System, where the longest records of human evolution are preserved. However, environmental indicators such as deep-sea oxygen isotopes, terrestrial dust flux, paleosol carbon isotopes, and lake sediments do not point consistently to any simple trend or climate driver of evolutionary change. Comparison of environmental indicators cautions against an exclusive focus on any given end-member of environmental fluctuation (driest or wettest, warmest or coolest), and argues for the impact of the entire range of variability in shaping evolutionary change. A model of alternating high and low climate variability for tropical Africa further implies that specific environmental indicators reflect different aspects of East African environmental dynamics. The model may thus help reconcile some of the conflicting interpretations about the environmental drivers of hominin evolution. First and last appearances of hominin lineages, benchmark biogeographic events, and the emergence of key adaptations and capacities to alter the surroundings are consistently concentrated in the predicted longest intervals of high climate variability. The view that emerges is that important changes in stone technology, sociality, and other aspects of hominin behavior can now be understood as adaptive responses to heightened habitat instability.},

Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult.

	abstract = {Identifying factors that influence animal density is a fundamental goal in ecology that has taken on new importance with the need to develop informed management plans. This is particularly the case for primates as the tropical forest that supports many species is being rapidly converted. We use a system of forest fragments adjacent to Kibale National Park, Uganda, to examine if food availability and parasite infections have synergistic affects on red colobus (Piliocolobus tephrosceles) abundance. Given that the size of primate populations can often respond slowly to environmental changes, we also examined how these factors influenced cortisol levels. To meet these objectives, we monitored gastrointestinal parasites, evaluated fecal cortisol levels, and determined changes in food availability by conducting complete tree inventories in eight fragments in 2000 and 2003. Red colobus populations declined by an average of 21\% among the fragments; however, population change ranged from a 25\% increase to a 57\% decline. The cumulative basal area of food trees declined by an average of 29.5\%; however, forest change was highly variable (a 2\% gain to a 71\% decline). We found that nematode prevalence averaged 58\% among fragments (range 29–83\%). The change in colobus population size was correlated both with food availability and a number of indices of parasite infections. A path analysis suggests that change in food availability has a strong direct effect on population size, but it also has an indirect effect via parasite infections.

	abstract = {The need to develop conservation plans calls for the ability to identify ecological factors that influence population density. Because stress is known to affect fecundity and mortality, increasing stress may provide a warning of potential population declines. We examined the effects of temporal variation in nutrition and parasitism on stress in endangered red colobus monkeys in Kibale National Park, Uganda. First, we tested the hypothesis that parasitism and nutrition would individually affect stress levels. We found that periods of poor-quality diet corresponded with an increase in cortisol. Similarly, increases in parasite infections were associated with increased cortisol. Next, we predicted that a poor-quality diet would facilitate increased parasite infections, and that together, they would lead to amplified stress. However, we found no support for such amplification, likely because the quality of the diet had little effect on parasite infections. Third, we tested whether individuals in a larger group were subject to food stress due to greater within-group competition, which would intensify nutritional stress and parasitism, and lead to reduced reproduction. Although we found no evidence to support a group size effect on parasites, cortisol levels in the large group tended to be higher than those in the small group, and the large group had fewer infants per female. The results suggest that parasitism and poor nutrition lead to increased stress which, because they are known to be associated with reduced fecundity and increased mortality, may lead to population declines.

Recent research has documented a richer repertoire of group-specific social conventions in the coalition-prone Cebus capucinus than in any other non-human primate species; these social rituals appear designed to test the strength of social bonds. Such diverse social conventions have not yet been noted in Cebus apella, despite extensive observation at multiple sites. The more robust and widely distributed C. apella is notable for the diversity of its tool-use repertoire, particularly in marginal habitats. Although C. capucinus does not often use tools, white-faced capuchins do specialize in foods requiring multi-step processing, and there are often multiple techniques used by different individuals within the same social group. Immatures preferentially observe foragers who are eating rare foods and hard-to-process foods. Young foragers, especially females, tend to adopt the same foraging techniques as their close associates.},

Chapters are written by the leading authorities in the field and organized around four major adaptive problems primates face as they strive to grow, maintain themselves, and reproduce in the wild. The inclusion of chapters on the behavior of humans at the end of each major section represents one particularly novel aspect of the book, and it will remind readers what we can learn about ourselves through research on nonhuman primates. The final section highlights some of the innovative and cutting-edge research designed to reveal the similarities and differences between nonhuman and human primate cognition. The Evolution of Primate Societies will be every bit the landmark publication its predecessor has been.},

	abstract = {In mammals, reproductive success may be positively correlated with both maternal age and social rank. Because social rank often increases with age, however, the effects of rank and age on reproductive success are difficult to separate. We studied a marked population of mountain goats, Oreamnos americanus, to assess the relative effects of maternal age and social rank on kid production and survival. Adult females formed a linear and stable dominance hierarchy. Kid production increased with both age-specific maternal social rank and age, but decreased slightly after 9 years of age. The influence of dominance was particularly important among 3- to 5-year-old females, and the positive effect of dominance on kid production decreased with increasing female age. Age-specific social rank and maternal age did not affect kid survival to autumn or to 1 year. Kids whose mothers were heavy for their age had a higher probability of surviving to weaning and to 1 year than kids born to light females. When age was accounted for, female survival was not related to social rank. Social rank appears to be an important determinant of reproductive success for female mountain goats, especially among young females.},

This model predicts that the form of short-term exchange of services depends on the relationship between the individuals involved. Here, we test this prediction in the exchange of grooming among males in a wild bonobo community for which close relatedness could be excluded. As bonobo males hardly engage in food sharing or agonistic support, grooming is mainly exchanged for grooming. While overall grooming, both given and received, correlates across dyads and within sessions, the form of grooming exchange within a given session differs according to dyadic association preferences. Individuals with a higher tendency to associate, ergo more familiar individuals, exhibit larger time differences and reduced reciprocation in consecutive grooming bouts than less familiar individuals. These results support the idea that emotional components are involved in the exchange of services between unrelated individuals.},

	abstract = {A growing body of evidence showing that individuals of some social species live in non-kin groups suggests kin selection is not required in all species for sociality to evolve. Here, we investigate 2 populations of Octodon degus, a widespread South American rodent that has been shown to form kin and non-kin groups. We quantified genetic relatedness among individuals in 23 social groups across 2 populations as well as social network parameters (association, strength, and clustering coefficient) in order to determine if these aspects of sociality were driven by kinship. Additionally, we analyzed social network parameters relative to ecological conditions at burrow systems used by groups, to determine if ecological characteristics within each population could explain variation in sociality. We found that genetic relatedness among individuals within social groups was not significantly higher than genetic relatedness among randomly selected individuals in both populations, suggesting that non-kin structure of groups is common in degus. In both populations, we found significant relationships between the habitat characteristics of burrow systems and the social network characteristics of individuals inhabiting those burrow systems. Our results suggest that degu sociality is non-kin based and that degu social networks are influenced by local conditions.Es creciente la evidencia que apoya la ocurrencia de especies sociales donde los individuos no están emparentados genéticamente, lo que sugiere que la selección de parentesco no es indispensable para la evolución de la sociabilidad. En este estudio se examinaron dos poblaciones de Octodon degus, un roedor sudamericano donde los grupos sociales pueden o no incluir individuos cercanamente emparentados. Se cuantificó el parentesco genético entre individuos en 23 grupos sociales y en redes sociales de dos poblaciones para determinar si estos aspectos de la sociabilidad dependen del grado de parentesco. Además, se examinaron asociaciones entre los parámetros cuantificados de las redes sociales (asociación, fuerza, coeficiente de anidamiento) y las condiciones ecológicas a nivel de los sistemas de madriguera usados por cada grupo. El grado de parentesco genético dentro de los grupos no fue distinto del grado de parentesco entre individuos de la población tomados al azar, lo que apoya que una estructura de grupos no emparentada es la regla en Octodon degus. En ambas poblaciones se registró una asociación entre características ecológicas de los sistemas de madriguera y atributos de las redes sociales de los individuos que usan estas estructuras. Nuestros resultados indican que la sociabilidad en Octodon degus no está basada en relaciones de parentesco y que las redes sociales de estos animales dependen de las condiciones ecológicas.},

A prominent hypothesis states that coalitions may be under cognitive constraints, but this idea is debated and remains to be tested empirically. In this study, we evaluate the cognitive constraint hypothesis against 3 alternative hypotheses that stress the role of demography, substrate use, and resource competition, for the evolution of male coalitions. A comparative analysis of a unique data set of 86 multimale multifemale groups of 38 nonhuman primate species from all major radiations revealed no evolutionary association of male coalition frequency with cognitive capacity (as indexed by neocortex ratio and endocranial volume). The observed variation was best explained by demography and resource competition in that male coalitions were more likely to occur in species characterized by larger male groups and reduced levels of contest competition (after controlling for phylogeny). These findings suggest that constraints imposed by the socioecological setting, rather than cognition, explain best why some primate species evolved customary coalitionary behavior while others did not. This study presents the first empirical evidence against the long-standing view that cognitive abilities may impose a limit on the use of coalitions in animals.},

	abstract = {Baboons were used in the past as models for human evolution. I utilize 40 years of data from my long-term study on baboons in Kenya to suggest that baboons are once again relevant for understanding human evolution, not as a referential model but to reset the starting conditions of the human experiment. The baboon data also offer a critique of widely held ideas about how natural selection might work by looking at real lives in real time. This situates competition in a matrix of collaboration and illustrates the critical role of chance, contingency, and history in baboon survival and success. I make three methodological moves to reach these conclusions. The first is to focus on process not just outcome. The second is to look at time scales longer than usual studies but shorter than evolutionary time as a way to open the black box that currently links behavior to evolutionary value. The third is to use comparative natural history, Darwin's method, as a way to capture and comprehend how complexity is generated and how baboons deal with it in their daily lives. These empirical and methodological turns lead to conclusions that run counter to widely held ideas about baboons, about primates, and about the determinism of natural selection. I follow my own research history to illustrate these points. The discussion ranges from alternative interpretations of the male and the female dominance hierarchies, to insights from a fission that happened when the foraging strategy of raiding and nonraiding baboons diverged, to evidence of adaptation after translocation, and finally to assessing two unusual fusions of baboon groups. Altogether, these natural histories yield baboon “principles of the social” with insights about cognition, cooperation, and culture and suggest why baboons can't become human. The data also support Weiss and Buchanan's framework (The Mermaid's Tale: Four Billion Years of Cooperation in the Making of Living Things. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press,2009. 305 p) with its alternative view of natural selection in which there is more slippage and tolerance, multiple solutions with larger acceptability spaces, and the possibility that an adaptive fit will be “good enough” rather than seamless. However, capturing behavioral complexity “in the wild” poses methodological challenges. Long-term field studies provide critical information but the current quantitative methods should be expanded also include natural history observations of behaviors and events across time, space, groups, and landscapes. Finally, the baboon natural histories illustrate how the evolutionary game has changed in the Anthropocene yielding a cautionary tale about the future for many primate species.

There is a clear philosophy, a sound criterion based in information theory, and a rigorous statistical foundation for AIC. AIC can be justified as Bayesian using a “savvy” prior on models that is a function of sample size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non-Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective. The philosophical context of what is assumed about reality, approximating models, and the intent of model-based inference should determine whether AIC or BIC is used.

These two observations are in direct conflict as such selection should deplete genetic variation. Furthermore, the presence of genetic variation in a trait, and selection acting on that trait, is often not sufficient for the trait to respond to selection. Here, we bring together geometric perspectives on mutation, selection, and genetic variation and show how the perceived incompatibility between these two observations is a consequence of taking a trait-by-trait approach to the multivariate problem of genetic variation and selection. We conclude that the simultaneous presence of widespead genetic variation in, and strong selection on, individual traits indicates that substantial multivariate genetic constraints are likely to be present in natural populations.},

	abstract = {Sociality presumably evolved because it leads to fitness benefits; yet we know little about what drives individual variability in sociality, particularly with respect to hierarchical levels of social organization. Social network architecture is based upon dyadic interactions, but the factors affecting pairwise relationships are not necessarily those affecting higher-level network-derived measures of social behavior. We examined the influence of relatedness, age, dominance, and reproductive status on proximal associations and social network centrality of individuals in the fission–fusion society of bighorn ewes (Ovis canadensis) at Ram Mountain, Canada. From 2011 to 2013, 63–81\% of adult ewes were equipped with proximity loggers, recording when they were within 1.5 m of one another. Ewe social structure was not random and individuals exhibited a tendency to have proximal associations that were consistent across years. Age and reproductive status appeared to have a weak effect on network centrality, but this effect was largely absent for frequency of proximal association. Furthermore, we found no effect of dominance rank on either proximal associations or network centrality. We speculate that interannual variation in these relationships may be indicative of predation affecting social dynamics. The disconnect between determinants that affect the costs and benefits of dyadic associations and those that emerge from network-derived behaviors highlights the importance of testing effects at multiple levels of social organization in animal societies.},

	abstract = {Undisturbed primate communities in the Neotropics are bottom-up structured as their biomass and species richness can be predicted from fruit production. However, the effects of fruit scarcity and the availability of forest types have not been fully analyzed, and seasonality is expected to differently affect small and large monkeys. The first aim of this study was to examine the effect of contrasting forest types within a location on the temporal variation in fruit production. The second was to assess the relative roles of disturbance, climate, patterns of fruit and leaf production, and plant composition on determining Neotropical primate communities. I compiled population density data for diurnal primate species from 154 sites to calculate species richness and assemblage biomass. Fruit abundance in the study sites was estimated from fruit trap data and phenology transects, and fruit variability was calculated as the monthly coefficient of variation (CV) and the length of the fruit scarcity period (LFSP). The results indicate that fruit production in floodplain forests is generally more variable than in terra firme forests, and this variation decreases in habitats with mixed forest types. Endozoochorous fruit production (based on fruit traps) and litter productivity were good predictors of the biomass of Neotropical primates (R2 = 0.83 and R2 = 0.59, respectively), but neither CV nor LFSP were good predictors. The biomass of large primates was independent of rainfall variation, but the biomass of small and medium sized monkeys was negatively correlated with temporal rainfall variability. Varzea forests tended to show higher biomass than those from terra firme and igapó. These results suggest that the production of fleshy fruits is the best predictor of the structure of primate assemblages in the Neotropics, but the effect of leaf quality and productivity remains to be investigated.

	abstract = {The ecological-constraints model assumes that food items occur in depletable patches and proposes that an increase in group size leads to increased day range due to more rapid patch depletion. Smaller groups become advantageous when an increase in travel costs is not repaid by an increase in energy gained or some other fitness advantage. On the other hand, we also know that group size can be influenced by social factors. Here we contrast the diet and group size of red colobus (Procolobus badius) and black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza) in Kibale National Park, Uganda to consider how ecological and social factors are affecting their group sizes. Subsequently, we examine whether the insights gained from this detailed comparison can provide an understanding of why the social organization and group size of mantled howlers (Alouatta palliata) and black howlers (A. pigra) differ. Two groups of red colobus and two groups of black-and-white colobus were studied over 10 months. Red colobus groups were larger (48 and 24) than black-and-white colobus groups (9 and 6). The two groups of red colobus overlap home ranges with the two groups of black-and-white colobus; 75\% and 95\% of their home ranges were within red colobus’s home range. There was a great deal of similarity in the plant parts eaten by the two species and both species fed primarily on young leaves (red colobus 70\%, black-and-white colobus 76\%). In terms of the actual species consumed, again there was a great deal of similarity between species. The average dietary overlap among months for the two neighboring groups of red colobus was 37.3\%, while the dietary overlap between the red colobus and the black-and-white colobus group that had its home range almost entirely within the home range of the red colobus groups averaged 43.2\% among months. If ecological conditions were responsible for the difference in group size between the two colobine species, one would expect the density of food trees to be lower in the home ranges of the black-and-white colobus monkeys, since they have the smaller group size. We found the opposite to be true. Both black-and-white colobus groups had more food trees and the cumulative size of those trees was greater than those in the red colobus’s home ranges. We quantify how these differences parallel differences in mantled and black howlers. The average group size for mantled howlers was 12.9 individuals, and for black howlers it was 5.3 individuals. We explore possible social constraints, such as infanticide, that prevent black-and-white colobus and black howlers from living in large groups.},

	abstract = {1.Understanding how animals interact with their physical and social environment is a major question in ecology but separating between these factors is often challenging. Observed interaction rates may reflect social behavior – preferences or avoidance of conspecifics or certain phenotypes. Yet, environmental spatiotemporal heterogeneity also affects individual space-use and interaction rates. For instance, clumped and ephemeral resources may force individuals to aggregate independently of sociality. 2.Proximity-based social networks (PBSNs) are becoming increasingly popular for studying social structures thanks to the parallel improvement of bio-tracking technologies and network randomization methods. While current methods focus on swapping individual identities among network-nodes or in the data-streams that underlies the network (e.g., individuals movement-paths), we still need better tools to distinguish between the contribution of sociality and other factors towards those interactions. 3.We propose a novel method that randomizes path segments among different time stamps within each individual separately (Part I). Temporal randomization of whole path segments (e.g., full days) retains their original spatial structure while decoupling synchronization among individuals. This allows researchers to compare observed dyadic association rates with those expected by chance given explicit space-use of the individuals in each dyad. 4.Further, since environmental changes are commonly much slower than the duration of social interactions we can differentiate between these two factors (Part II). First, an individual's path is divided into time-windows and days are randomized within each time-window. Then, by exploring how the deviations between randomized and observed networks change as a function of time-window length we can refine our null-model to account also for temporal changes in the activity areas. 5.We used biased-correlated random walk models to simulate populations of socially-indifferent or sociable agents for testing our method for both false-positive and negative errors. Applying the method to a dataset of GPS-tracked sleepy lizards (Tiliqua rugosa) demonstrated its ability to reveal the social organization in free-ranging animals while accounting for confounding factors of environmental spatiotemporal heterogeneity. This method is robust to sampling-bias and applicable for a wide range of systems and tracking techniques, and can be extended to test for preferential phenotypic assortment within PBSNs.

	abstract = {Life history and socioecological factors have been linked to species-specific patterns of growth across female vertebrates. For example, greater maternal investment in offspring has been associated with more discrete periods of growth and reproduction. However, in primates it has been difficult to test such hypotheses because very few studies have obtained growth measurements from wild populations. Here we utilize a promising noninvasive photogrammetric method—parallel lasers—to examine shoulder-rump (SR) growth in a wild primate, the gelada (Theropithecus gelada, Simien Mountains National Park, Ethiopia). In this species, a graminivorous diet coupled with high extrinsic infant mortality risk suggests that maternal investment in neonates is low. Therefore, in contrast with other closely related papionins, we expected female geladas to exhibit less discrete periods of growth and reproduction. For both sexes, we compared size-for-age patterns (N = 154 females; N = 110 males) and changes in growth velocity relative to major life history milestones. Female geladas finished 88.5\% of SR growth by first sexual swelling, and 97.2\% by first reproduction, reaching adult body size by 7.72 years of age. Compared to closely related papionins, gelada females finished more growth by first reproduction, despite producing relatively small, and presumably “cheap,” neonates. Male geladas finished 85.4\% of growth at dispersal, and 96.0\% at estimated first birth. Contrary to other polygynous primates, males are larger than females because they grow for a longer period of time (not because they grow faster), surpassing females around 6 years of age when female growth slows. Our results demonstrate that parallel lasers are an easy and promising new method that can be used to construct comprehensive life history perspectives that were once out of reach for wild populations.

	abstract = {Summary We hypothesise that foraging group size (FGS) and population group size (PGS) in primates and carnivores are related to quantifiable variables indexing the intensity of exploitative competition. Group size is predicted to increase with both food density and travel capabilities, as estimated by the “constraint-free day-range” (DRs), i.e. the day-range of a solitary individual uninfluenced by competition from conspecifics. We test this “exploitation competition” hypothesis among primates and carnivores, using data on populations, species and genera. Food density was indexed by population density. Where DRs could be estimated by regression it was found to be correlated with observed day-range (DRm). DRs was therefore indexed by DRm in all species. Population density and DRm were associated with each other, but in a multiple regression each variable contributed independently to explaining variation in group size. PGS was predicted better than FGS, but regressions involving either measure of group size were significant in all analyses. The multiple regression analyses were validated by the method of linear contrasts, which accounts for possible lack of independence among taxa. We conclude that species differences in group size are influenced by both food density and DRs. This suggests that variation in the intensity of exploitation competition is partly responsible for differences in group size.},

	abstract = {In many social animals, individuals derive fitness benefits from close social bonds, which are often formed among kin of the philopatric sex. Hamadryas baboons, however, exhibit a hierarchical, multilevel social system where both sexes disperse from their natal one-male-unit (OMU). Although this would seem to hinder maintenance of kin ties, both sexes appear largely philopatric at the higher order band and clan levels, possibly allowing for bonds with same sex kin by both males and females. In order to investigate the possibility of kin bonds in hamadryas baboons, we identified kin dyads in a band without known pedigree information using a large panel of genetic markers: 1 Y-linked, 4 X-linked, and 23 autosomal microsatellites and part of the mitochondrial hypervariable region I. With these data, we performed a kinship analysis while accounting for misclassification rates through simulations and determined kinship among two types of dyads: leader and follower males and female dyads within OMUs. Leader and follower males were maternal relatives more often than expected by chance, suggesting that kinship plays a role in the formation of these relationships. Moreover, maternal female relatives were found in the same OMU more often than expected by chance, indicating that females may be motivated to maintain post-dispersal contact with maternal female kin. Our results suggest that hamadryas baboons can recognize maternal kin and that kin selection has contributed to shaping their complex social system. This implies that an ancestral maternal kin bias has been retained in hamadryas society. Am. J. Primatol. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We investigated the association patterns of female bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, in the eastern gulf of Shark Bay, Western Australia and found that they depended upon the complex interplay of at least three factors: home range overlap, matrilineal kinship and biparental kinship. While home range overlap was positively correlated with female association patterns, preferred associations were found between females showing as little as 27\% home range overlap, and some pairs showed avoidance despite 100\% home range overlap. Furthermore, on average, both casual and preferred associations took place between females that were more closely biparentally related than expected by chance and this pattern varied depending upon whether or not pairs of females shared the same matriline.},

Despite this, the relative importance and interactions of genetic and social factors involved in the evolution of fitness traits in wild mammalian populations are largely unknown. To date, a few studies have demonstrated that fitness might be influenced by either social factors or genes in natural populations, but none have explored how the combined effect of social and genetic parameters might interact to influence fitness. Drawing from a long-term study of wild bottlenose dolphins in the eastern gulf of Shark Bay, Western Australia, we present a unique approach to understanding these interactions. Our study shows that female calving success depends on both genetic inheritance and social bonds. Moreover, we demonstrate that interactions between social and genetic factors also influence female fitness. Therefore, our study represents a major methodological advance, and provides critical insights into the interplay of genetic and social parameters of fitness.},

	abstract = {Reversing forest loss through reforestation has become a critical strategy to decrease global climate change, and such programs are more likely to be initiated if they can produce a subsequent monetary gain for the host country. As a result, the planting of monocultures of harvestable trees has become widespread and the practice is accelerating. However, little is known about the effect of such reforestation strategies on biodiversity. Here we quantify the demographic patterns of a population of black howlers (Alouatta pigra) living in a 200-ha eucalyptus plantation with connected remnant forests in southeastern Mexico. We compare our results to data from the literature from forest fragments, extensive forest tracts, and different agrosystems. The howler population inhabiting the plantation grew from 69 individuals in 2007 to 77 in 2008 (11.6\% growth) and to 84 in 2009 (9.1\% growth). During this time the howlers fed extensively on the native vegetation that was growing under the eucalyptus, vines that grew on the plantation trees, and adjacent areas of native secondary growth, but they almost never fed on eucalyptus. Howler density in the plantation was greater than in extensive forest tracts or forest fragments, whereas mean group size was similar to that in the forest tracts and greater than in the fragments and agrosystems. There was no apparent difference in the adult female-to-immature ratio among sites. Our results indicate that plantations that have associated native vegetation can play a positive role in the conservation of this species, but suggest that harvesting regimens must be carefully orchestrated to prevent associated food scarcity.},

Here, we present data suggesting that in 2002 and 2003 ZEBOV killed about 5000 gorillas in our study area. The lag between neighboring gorilla groups in mortality onset was close to the ZEBOV disease cycle length, evidence that group-to-group transmission has amplified gorilla die-offs.

However, there has been relatively little consideration of how females' relationships with males may influence the nature of females' relationships to other females. Here, we show that female olive baboons form well-differentiated relationships with adult males and these ties influence their relationships with other females. As in other species of savanna baboons, female olive baboons show pronounced preferences for close kin, but related females do not often share the same top-ranked male partners. Shared associations with males bring females into more frequent contact with distant kin and nonkin. The combined effects of bringing distantly related and unrelated females together and separating close kin reduced the extent of nepotistic biases among females in the study groups compared to female yellow baboons, Papio cynocephalus, and chacma baboons, Papio ursinus. These data suggest that selective pressures acting on both females and males may influence the nature and function of female–female relationships.},

	abstract = {Social network analysis has become increasingly used to investigate the consequences of individuals’ social tendencies in recent years; however, the question of whether individuals are consistent in their social network position over time or situations has received comparatively scant attention. Knowledge of the degree to which individuals are stable in their social behavior can improve our understanding the fitness consequences of processes such as the transmission of disease and social information through networks, as well as the evolution of social behavior and social structure in general. Here, I investigated individual consistency in social behavior in wild vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerthrus) residing in a highly seasonal habitat. I constructed grooming networks for three time periods characterized by diverse environmental conditions and explored the repeatability of seven network metrics as well as the effects of sex and dominance rank on these metrics. Both female and male vervets were highly consistent in three correlated, weighted measures of social connectedness—grooming in-strength, out-strength, and eigenvector centrality, and in-degree was moderately repeatable in both sexes. In contrast, only males were consistent in their out-degree and clustering coefficient, and there was no evidence of consistency in betweenness for either sex. High-ranking females had higher in-degree and in-strength scores, and high-ranking males had lower out-degree and out-strength, but controlling for dominance rank did not affect the findings regarding the repeatability of any metric. These results add to the small number of studies that have explored the temporal and situational stability of social network phenotypes in wild animals.Significance statementRelatively few animal social network studies have examined whether individuals are consistent in the positions that they occupy within networks. Determining the degree to which individuals are consistent in their social network characteristics over time and across naturally changing conditions is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology and evolution of social behavior. In this study, I examined individual consistency in several components of social network position in vervet monkeys residing in a highly seasonal environment. I also evaluated the effects of sex and dominance rank on these measures of sociality. I found that both male and female vervets were consistent in most measures of direct connectedness in grooming networks across seasons, but metrics capturing indirect social connections were overall less repeatable. Controlling for the effects of dominance rank on sociality measures did not change these results.},

	abstract = {Individuals who are well integrated into society have greater access to resources and tend to live longer. Why some individuals are socially isolated and others are not is therefore puzzling from an evolutionary perspective. Answering this question requires establishing the mix of intrinsic and contextual factors that contribute to social isolation. Using social network data spanning up to half of the median adult lifespan in a gregarious primate, we found that some measures of social isolation were modestly repeatable within individuals, consistent with a trait. By contrast, social isolation was not explained by the identity of an animal’s mother or the group into which it was born. Nevertheless, age, sex and social status each played a role, as did kin dynamics and familiarity. Females with fewer close relatives were more isolated, and the more time males spent in a new group the less isolated they became, independent of their social status. These results show that social isolation results from a combination of intrinsic and environmental factors. From an evolutionary perspective, these findings suggest that social isolation could be adaptive in some contexts and partly maintained by selection.},

	abstract = {1.The disease costs of sociality have largely been understood through the link between group size and transmission. However, infectious disease spread is driven primarily by the social organization of interactions in a group and not its size. 2.We used statistical models to review the social network organization of 47 species, including mammals, birds, reptiles, fish and insects by categorizing each species into one of three social systems, relatively solitary, gregarious and socially hierarchical. Additionally, using computational experiments of infection spread, we determined the disease costs of each social system. 3.We find that relatively solitary species have large variation in number of social partners, that socially hierarchical species are the least clustered in their interactions, and that social networks of gregarious species tend to be the most fragmented. However, these structural differences are primarily driven by weak connections, which suggests that different social systems have evolved unique strategies to organize weak ties. 4.Our synthetic disease experiments reveal that social network organization can mitigate the disease costs of group living for socially hierarchical species when the pathogen is highly transmissible. In contrast, highly transmissible pathogens cause frequent and prolonged epidemic outbreaks in gregarious species. 5.We evaluate the implications of network organization across social systems despite methodological challenges, and our findings offer new perspective on the debate about the disease costs of group living. Additionally, our study demonstrates the potential of meta-analytic methods in social network analysis to test ecological and evolutionary hypotheses on cooperation, group living, communication, and resilience to extrinsic pressures.

	abstract = {I develop guidelines for assessing the precision and power of statistical techniques that are frequently used to study nonhuman social systems using observed dyadic associations. Association indexes estimate the proportion of time that two individuals are associated. Binomial approximation and nonparametric bootstrap methods produce similar estimates of the precision of association indexes. For a mid-range (0.4–0.9) association index to have a standard error of less than 0.1 requires about 15 observations of the pair associated, and for it to be less than 0.05, this rises to 50 observations. The coefficient of variation among dyads of the proportion of time that pairs of individuals are actually associated describes social differentiation (S), and this may be estimated from association data using maximum likelihood. With a poorly differentiated population (S∼0.2), a data set needs about five observed associations per dyad to achieve a correlation between true and estimated association indexes of r=∼0.4. It requires about 10 times as much data to achieve a representation with r=∼0.8. Permutation tests usually reject the null hypothesis that individuals have no preferred associates when S2×H{\textgreater}5, where H is the mean number of observed associations per individual. Thus most situations require substantial numbers of observations of associations to give useful portrayals of social systems, and sparse association data inform only when social differentiation is high.},

Leaves from secondary vegetation can provide nutritious resources to folivorous primates, whereas frugivores, burdened with a scattered spatial and temporal distribution of fruiting resources, require larger home ranges, potentially limiting their ability to cope with altered landscapes. Within coastal southeastern Madagascar, we sought to determine whether two lemur species occupying contrasting ecological niches respond differently to the changing features of their degraded and fragmented habitat. We conducted behavioral observations between 2011 and 2013 on frugivorous collared brown lemurs (Eulemur collaris) and folivorous southern bamboo lemurs (Hapalemur meridionalis). To estimate the ability of lemurs to use pioneer species, we categorized all plants used for feeding and resting as fast growing, mid-growing, or slow growing. We fitted general linear mixed-effects models, one for each plant growth category with monthly proportional use rates as the dependent variable, and included species (E. collaris and H. meridionalis), activity (feeding and resting), and season (dry and wet) as fixed effects. Our results show that E. collaris used both slow- and mid-growing plant species most often, while H. meridionalis were more likely to use fast-growing plants, which indicated an ability to use secondary/disturbed vegetation. Frugivorous E. collaris appear more limited by climax plants, while folivorous H. meridionalis appear to be slightly more adaptable, a finding that is consistent with that for other primate folivores.},

To evaluate people’s use of this crop and to measure the effect of this increase on slow loris behavior, home ranges, and sleep sites, we conducted interviews with local farmers and analysed the above variables in relation to chayote expansion between 2011 and 2015. Interviews with farmers in 2011, 2013, and 2015 confirm the importance of chayote and of bamboo and slow lorises in their agricultural practices. In 2015 chayote frames covered 12\% of land in Cipaganti, occupying 4\% of slow loris home ranges, which marginally yet insignificantly increased in size with the increase in chayote. Slow lorises are arboreal and the bamboo frames increased connectivity within their ranges. Of the sleep sites we monitored from 2013 to 2016, 24 had disappeared, and 201 continued to be used by the slow lorises and processed by local people. The fast growth rate of bamboo, and the recognition of the value of bamboo by farmers, allow persistence of slow loris sleep sites. Overall introduction of chayote did not result in conflict between farmers and slow lorises, and once constructed the chayote bamboo frames proved to be beneficial for slow lorises.},

	abstract = {Introduction
As urban and rural land development become widespread features of the global landscape so an understanding of the landscape requirements of displaced and isolated wildlife species becomes increasingly important for conservation planning. In the Cape Peninsula, South Africa, rapid human population growth, and the associated urban and rural land transformation, threatens the sustainability of the local chacma baboon population. Here we analyse spatial data collected from nine of the 12 extant troops to determine their population-level landscape requirements. We use hurdle models to ascertain the key landscape features influencing baboon occurrence and abundance patterns on two hierarchical spatial scales.

Results
Both spatial scales produced similar results that were ecologically reliable and interpretable. The models indicated that baboons were more likely to occur, and be more abundant, at low altitudes, on steep slopes and in human-modified habitats. The combination of these landscape variables provides baboons with access to the best quality natural and anthropogenic food sources in close proximity to one another and suitable sleeping sites. Surface water did not emerge as an influential landscape feature presumably as the area is not water stressed.

Conclusions
The model results indicate that land development in the Cape Peninsula has pushed baboons into increasingly marginal natural habitat while simultaneously providing them with predictable and easily accessible food sources in human-modified habitats. The resultant spatial competition between humans and baboons explains the high levels of human-baboon conflict and further erosion of the remaining land fragments is predicted to exacerbate competition. This study demonstrates how the quantification of animal landscape requirements can provide a mechanism for identifying priority conservation areas at the human-wildlife interface.},

	abstract = {When possible, many species will shift in elevation or latitude in response to rising temperatures. However, before such shifts occur, individuals will first tolerate environmental change and then modify their behavior to maintain heat balance. Behavioral thermoregulation allows animals a range of climatic tolerances and makes predicting geographic responses under future warming scenarios challenging. Because behavioral modification may reduce an individual's fecundity by, for example, limiting foraging time and thus caloric intake, we must consider the range of behavioral options available for thermoregulation to accurately predict climate change impacts on individual species. To date, few studies have identified mechanistic links between an organism's daily activities and the need to thermoregulate. We used a biophysical model, Niche Mapper, to mechanistically model microclimate conditions and thermoregulatory behavior for a temperature-sensitive mammal, the American pika (Ochotona princeps). Niche Mapper accurately simulated microclimate conditions, as well as empirical metabolic chamber data for a range of fur properties, animal sizes, and environmental parameters. Niche Mapper predicted pikas would be behaviorally constrained because of the need to thermoregulate during the hottest times of the day. We also showed that pikas at low elevations could receive energetic benefits by being smaller in size and maintaining summer pelage during longer stretches of the active season under a future warming scenario. We observed pika behavior for 288 h in Glacier National Park, Montana, and thermally characterized their rocky, montane environment. We found that pikas were most active when temperatures were cooler, and at sites characterized by high elevations and north-facing slopes. Pikas became significantly less active across a suite of behaviors in the field when temperatures surpassed 20°C, which supported a metabolic threshold predicted by Niche Mapper. In general, mechanistic predictions and empirical observations were congruent. This research is unique in providing both an empirical and mechanistic description of the effects of temperature on a mammalian sentinel of climate change, the American pika. Our results suggest that previously underinvestigated characteristics, specifically fur properties and body size, may play critical roles in pika populations' response to climate change. We also demonstrate the potential importance of considering behavioral thermoregulation and microclimate variability when predicting animal responses to climate change.},

Temporary peripheral subgroups of varying sizes and compositions preceded fission by 9–40 months. Fission crystallized within a month through an increase and stabilization of subgroup membership and permanent division. All members in the newly seceded groups had been frequent participants in pre-fission subgroups, and belonged to subordinate matrilineages. Subgroups, and hence group divisions, were initiated by cores of mutually loyal females and occurred mostly along kinship lines. In the year of fissions, the rate of change in female dominance relations was significantly greater among groups that divided than among those that did not. It is hypothesized that low-ranking females secede to form new groups when the costs, especially of intragroup competition for food resources, outweigh the benefits of group membership. Such seceding females were easily available and familiar mates for group males that had recently lost rank. Final division, therefore, resulted from a coalition of subordinate females and males acting according to their respective interests. It was triggered in this population by rapid growth of some groups to large size and by environmental stress (the reduction and fragmentation of food resources caused by drought and a cyclone), which accentuated the costs of resource competition. Male aggression, such as infanticide, which negatively affects female fitness, might also have contributed to one group fission.},

	abstract = {Earth's rapidly changing climate creates a growing need to understand how demographic processes in natural populations are affected by climate variability, particularly among organisms threatened by extinction. Long-term, large-scale, and cross-taxon studies of vital rate variation in relation to climate variability can be particularly valuable because they can reveal environmental drivers that affect multiple species over extensive regions. Few such data exist for animals with slow life histories, particularly in the tropics, where climate variation over large-scale space is asynchronous. As our closest relatives, nonhuman primates are especially valuable as a resource to understand the roles of climate variability and climate change in human evolutionary history. Here, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of vital rate variation in relation to climate variability among wild primates. We ask whether primates are sensitive to global changes that are universal (e.g., higher temperature, large-scale climate oscillations) or whether they are more sensitive to global change effects that are local (e.g., more rain in some places), which would complicate predictions of how primates in general will respond to climate change. To address these questions, we use a database of long-term life-history data for natural populations of seven primate species that have been studied for 29–52 years to investigate associations between vital rate variation, local climate variability, and global climate oscillations. Associations between vital rates and climate variability varied among species and depended on the time windows considered, highlighting the importance of temporal scale in detection of such effects. We found strong climate signals in the fertility rates of three species. However, survival, which has a greater impact on population growth, was little affected by climate variability. Thus, we found evidence for demographic buffering of life histories, but also evidence of mechanisms by which climate change could affect the fates of wild primates.},

	abstract = {Assessments of the status of endangered species have focused on population sizes, often without knowledge of demographic and behavioral processes underlying population recovery. We analyzed demographic data from a 28-year study of a critically endangered primate, the northern muriqui, to investigate possible changes in demographic rates as this population recovered from near extirpation. As the population increased from 60 to nearly 300 individuals, its growth rate declined due to increased mortality and male-biased birth sex ratios; the increased mortality was not uniform across ages and sexes, and there has been a recent increase in mortality of prime-aged males. If not for a concurrent increase in fertility rates, the population would have stabilized at 200 individuals instead of continuing to grow. The unexpected increase in fertility rates and in adult male mortality can be attributed to the muriquis’ expansion of their habitat by spending more time on the ground. The demographic consequences of this behavioral shift must be incorporated into management tactics for this population and emphasize the importance of understanding demographic rates in the recovery of endangered species.},

An intensive study in 1986–1988 of two groups of colobus in the Tana River Primate National Reserve indicated that habitat disturbance from the changing river course and shifting agricultural practices were primarily responsible for the decline. Clearcutting around Mchelelo forest in the late 1960s compressed colobus populations to levels probably above the carrying capacity. Between 1975 and 1986 primate population density declined dramatically, the number of red colobus groups in Mchelelo forest decreased by half, and the size of the remaining group was greatly reduced. In 1986, there were fewer solitary colobus and small parties in the forest, harem male takeovers did not occur, infant survivorship increased, and demographic parameters generally had improved. The colobus groups in Mchelelo in 1973–1975, living at higher densities, showed different feeding and ranging behaviors than 1986–1988 groups. Range size was smaller in 1975, range overlap occurred, and a greater portion of the forest was used per day and per month. Mature leaves accounted for a much higher proportion of the diet. Time spent feeding and resting was the same in both studies. Social organization in predominantly one- male groups was maintained and adult and subadult females transferred between groups.},

	abstract = {The socioecological model is to date the best evolutionary model to explain variation in primate behaviour. Some species or populations, however, deviate from the predictions. These deviations may be due to a disequilibrium between evolutionary causes and behavioural adaptations, caused by recent human changes of the environment. The relationship between human habitat alteration and primate social behaviour is reviewed and investigated for langurs. Provisioning affects the spatial distribution of food. In these areas, but also in areas with natural monopolizable food sources, female dominance relationships are linear, but not nepotistic. This does not fit into the evolutionary model. Provisioning also affects the temporal distribution of food. This reduces the seasonality of mating, increases female monopolizability and gives rise to more one-male groups than in undisturbed areas. A human reduction of the number of predators leads to fewer males per group. It also results in female philopatry. Infanticide risk was higher in disturbed than in undisturbed areas. This was not caused by the lower proportion of one-male groups in disturbed areas, but by the lack of female dispersal. Thus, female behaviour was affected by human habitat disturbance in a way that does not fit the socioecological model. However, the extension of habitat disturbance does not explain all results. We could say that the model is refuted. Phylogenetic constraints, however, do explain the behaviour of despotic Hanuman langurs. Such phylogenetic constraints complement the socioecological model. To understand the evolutionary history of a current set of features, these two approaches should be studied simultaneously.},

We review the environmental threats from African mining development, including habitat alteration, infrastructure expansion, human migration, bushmeat hunting, corruption, and weak governance. We illustrate these threats in Central Africa, which contains the vast Congo rainforest, and show that more than a quarter of 4,151 recorded mineral occurrences are concentrated in three regions of biological endemism—the Cameroon-Gabon Lowlands, Eastern DRC Lowlands, and Albertine Rift Mountains—and that most of these sites are currently unprotected. Threats are not uniform spatially, and much of the Congo Basin is devoid of mineral occurrences and may be spared from direct mining impacts. Some of the environmental impacts of African mining development could potentially be offset: mining set-asides could protect some wildlife habitats, whereas improving transportation networks could increase crop yields and spare land for conservation. Research and policy measures are needed to (1) understand the synergies between mining and other development activities, (2) improve environmental impact assessments, (3) devise mitigation and offsetting mechanisms, and (4) identify market choke points where lobbying can improve environmental practice. Without careful management, rapid mining expansion and its associated secondary effects will have severe impacts on African environments and biodiversity.},

Much of the investment is in high-volume minerals such as iron and coal that will require heavy infrastructure and large settled workforces. New roads and railways are being built to support these industries. Mineral infrastructure is reinforcing the dynamic of designated “growth corridors”, which are increasingly determining settlement patterns and rural land use in Africa. These corridors are penetrating into areas where agriculture has been constrained by lack of access to markets. They could unleash a major expansion of arable crops in the Guinea and Miombo savannahs, tropical tree crops in Congo Basin rainforests and irrigated agriculture on the floodplains of several African river systems. Rapidly growing African cities are largely dependent on imported food but growth corridors linking them to hinterland areas could favour shifts to African-sourced foods. Governance weaknesses may allow outside investors to make land grabs along growth corridors and further marginalise poor smallholders. New pressures on environmentally sensitive areas may emerge. Policy changes are needed to avoid negative impacts of this major new development trend and to exploit the potential for poverty alleviation and food-security benefits.},

	abstract = {In order to understand the ecological adaptations of primates to survive in temperate forests, we need to know the general patterns of plant phenology in temperate and tropical forests. Comparative analyses have been employed to investigate general trends in the seasonality and abundance of fruit and young leaves in tropical and temperate forests. Previous studies have shown that (1) fruit fall biomass in temperate forest is lower than in tropical forest, (2) non-fleshy species, in particular acorns, comprise the majority of the fruit biomass in temperate forest, (3) the duration of the fruiting season is shorter in temperate forest, and (4) the fruiting peak occurs in autumn in most temperate forests. Through our comparative analyses of the fruiting and flushing phenology between Asian temperate and tropical forests, we revealed that (1) fruiting is more annually periodic (the pattern in one year is similar to that seen in the next year) in temperate forest in terms of the number of fruiting species or trees, (2) there is no consistent difference in interannual variations in fruiting between temperate and tropical forests, although some oak-dominated temperate forests exhibit extremely large interannual variations in fruiting, (3) the timing of the flushing peak is predictable (in spring and early summer), and (4) the duration of the flushing season is shorter. The flushing season in temperate forests (17–28 \% of that in tropical forests) was quite limited, even compared to the fruiting season (68 \%). These results imply that temperate primates need to survive a long period of scarcity of young leaves and fruits, but the timing is predictable. Therefore, a dependence on low-quality foods, such as mature leaves, buds, bark, and lichens, would be indispensable for temperate primates. Due to the high predictability of the timing of fruiting and flushing in temperate forests, fat accumulation during the fruit-abundant period and fat metabolization during the subsequent fruit-scarce period can be an effective strategy to survive the lean period (winter).},

Long-term studies of primate communities across multiple habitat types at small spatial scales are rare, yet can improve our understanding of habitat and resource use. Within primate community ecology, there has been recent interest in studying primate species in the context of the broader faunal communities of which they are a part because interactions with ecologically similar but distantly related species may influence habitat use. We present the results of a 64-mo study of 10 vertebrate frugivore species with highly overlapping diets inhabiting seven distinct forest types at the Cabang Panti Research Station, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. We used survey transects and phenology plots to measure variation in vertebrate population densities (four primate, three hornbill, two squirrel, and one pig species) and fruit resources over space and time. We found little evidence of habitat partitioning or specialization. Densities of all 10 frugivore species, however, varied spatially, due largely to elevation and forest structure. Ordination analyses demonstrated that forest types differed in their structure, floristic composition, plant phenology, and frugivore communities. We also documented substantial temporal variation in orangutan densities, reflecting movements over large spatial scales. The densities of other mammalian and avian frugivores, particularly other primates, varied comparatively little over time. Our results demonstrate the importance of forest structure for determining frugivore community structure and highlight the importance of lowland forest types for the conservation of tropical frugivores.},

Therefore, humanity needs to address anthropogenic population extirpation and decimation immediately. That conclusion is based on analyses of the numbers and degrees of range contraction (indicative of population shrinkage and/or population extinctions according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature) using a sample of 27,600 vertebrate species, and on a more detailed analysis documenting the population extinctions between 1900 and 2015 in 177 mammal species. We find that the rate of population loss in terrestrial vertebrates is extremely high—even in “species of low concern.” In our sample, comprising nearly half of known vertebrate species, 32\% (8,851/27,600) are decreasing; that is, they have decreased in population size and range. In the 177 mammals for which we have detailed data, all have lost 30\% or more of their geographic ranges and more than 40\% of the species have experienced severe population declines ({\textgreater}80\% range shrinkage). Our data indicate that beyond global species extinctions Earth is experiencing a huge episode of population declines and extirpations, which will have negative cascading consequences on ecosystem functioning and services vital to sustaining civilization. We describe this as a “biological annihilation” to highlight the current magnitude of Earth’s ongoing sixth major extinction event.},

	abstract = {As they have in response to past climatic changes, many species will shift their distributions in response to modern climate change. However, due to the unprecedented rapidity of projected climatic changes, some species may not be able to move their ranges fast enough to track shifts in suitable climates and associated habitats. Here, we investigate the ability of 493 mammals to keep pace with projected climatic changes in the Western Hemisphere. We modeled the velocities at which species will likely need to move to keep pace with projected changes in suitable climates. We compared these velocities with the velocities at which species are able to move as a function of dispersal distances and dispersal frequencies. Across the Western Hemisphere, on average, 9.2\% of mammals at a given location will likely be unable to keep pace with climate change. In some places, up to 39\% of mammals may be unable to track shifts in suitable climates. Eighty-seven percent of mammalian species are expected to experience reductions in range size and 20\% of these range reductions will likely be due to limited dispersal abilities as opposed to reductions in the area of suitable climate. Because climate change will likely outpace the response capacity of many mammals, mammalian vulnerability to climate change may be more extensive than previously anticipated.},

Even though plant reproduction depends largely on seed dispersal, evolutionary ecologists have been unable to link co-occurring traits in fruits with differences in behavior, physiology, and morphology of fruit-eating vertebrates. Hence, the origin and maintenance of fruit diversity remains largely unexplained. Using a multivariate phylogenetic comparative test with unbiased estimates of odor and color in figs, we demonstrate that fruit traits evolve in concert and as predicted by differences in the behavior, physiology (perceptive ability) and morphology of their frugivorous seed dispersers. The correlated evolution of traits results in the convergence of general appearance of fruits in species that share disperser types. Observations at fruiting trees independently confirmed that differences in fig traits predict differences in dispersers. Taken together, these results demonstrate that differences among frugivores have shaped the evolution of fruit traits. More broadly, our results underscore the importance of mutualisms in both generating and maintaining biodiversity.},

Animal social networks are descriptions of social structure which, aside from their intrinsic interest for understanding sociality, can have significant bearing across many fields of biology.



*
Network analysis provides a flexible toolbox for testing a broad range of hypotheses, and for describing the social system of species or populations in a quantitative and comparable manner. However, it requires careful consideration of underlying assumptions, in particular differentiating real from observed networks and controlling for inherent biases that are common in social data.



*
We provide a practical guide for using this framework to analyse animal social systems and test hypotheses. First, we discuss key considerations when defining nodes and edges, and when designing methods for collecting data. We discuss different approaches for inferring social networks from these data and displaying them. We then provide an overview of methods for quantifying properties of nodes and networks, as well as for testing hypotheses concerning network structure and network processes. Finally, we provide information about assessing the power and accuracy of an observed network.



*
Alongside this manuscript, we provide appendices containing background information on common programming routines and worked examples of how to perform network analysis using the r programming language.



*
We conclude by discussing some of the major current challenges in social network analysis and interesting future directions. In particular, we highlight the under-exploited potential of experimental manipulations on social networks to address research questions.},

	abstract = {1.In iteroparous species, intermittent breeding is an important life-history tactic that can greatly affect animal population growth and viability. Despite its importance, few studies have quantified the consequences of breeding pauses on lifetime reproductive output, principally because calculating lifetime reproductive output requires knowledge of each individual's entire reproductive history. This information is extremely difficult to obtain in wild populations. 2.We applied novel statistical approaches that account for uncertainty in state assessment and individual heterogeneity to an 18-year capture-recapture dataset of 6 631 female southern elephant seals from Macquarie Island. We estimated survival and breeding probabilities, and investigated the consequences of intermittent breeding on lifetime reproductive output. 3.We found consistent differences in females’ demographic performance between two heterogeneity classes. In particular, breeding imbued a high cost on survival in the females from the heterogeneity class 2, assumed to be females of lower quality. Individual quality also appeared to play a major role in a female's decision to skip reproduction with females of poorer quality more likely to skip breeding events than females of higher quality. 4.Skipping some breeding events allowed females from both heterogeneity classes to increase lifetime reproductive output over females that bred annually. However, females of lower quality produced less offspring over their lifetime. 5.Intermittent breeding seems to be used by female southern elephant seals as a tactic to offset reproductive costs on survival and enhance lifetime reproductive output but remains unavoidable and driven by individual-specific constraints in some other females.

We have previously introduced a version of R2 that we called {\textless}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/sites/default/files/highwire/royinterface/14/134/20170213/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif"/{\textgreater} for Poisson and binomial GLMMs, but not for other distributional families. Similarly, we earlier discussed how to estimate intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) using Poisson and binomial GLMMs. In this paper, we generalize our methods to all other non-Gaussian distributions, in particular to negative binomial and gamma distributions that are commonly used for modelling biological data. While expanding our approach, we highlight two useful concepts for biologists, Jensen's inequality and the delta method, both of which help us in understanding the properties of GLMMs. Jensen's inequality has important implications for biologically meaningful interpretation of GLMMs, whereas the delta method allows a general derivation of variance associated with non-Gaussian distributions. We also discuss some special considerations for binomial GLMMs with binary or proportion data. We illustrate the implementation of our extension by worked examples from the field of ecology and evolution in the R environment. However, our method can be used across disciplines and regardless of statistical environments.},

	abstract = {Fission–fusion social dynamics allow animals to respond to short-term environmental changes by temporarily adjusting group size. The drivers of such complex social dynamics are thought to relate to resource availability, density effects, and social interactions. During 2008–2009, we collared 15 Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer) cows in different groups in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, to study social dynamics in a flood-pulsed ecosystem. Hierarchical clustering identified 2 subpopulations, 1 migratory and 1 resident. We calculated Utilization Distribution Overlap Index (UDOI) and number and duration of fusion events between buffalo dyads and related them to environmental variables. Number of fusion events and duration of fusion periods did not vary seasonally, total fusion time varied seasonally and annually, and UDOI varied with year and subpopulation. Fission events were more likely in cluttered habitats, but only in the late flood season. There was more open habitat in home range overlap (HRO) areas than home ranges (HR) in most seasons. Pan density in rainy season HROs was lower and higher than in HRs in 2008 and 2009, respectively, and in all flood seasons HRO areas were closer to permanent water than HRs, suggesting that fusion occurred when buffalo congregated on resources. Whereas previous studies described large herds that sometimes split, we identified numerous smaller groups that occasionally fused, indicating a very fluid social system. Our results highlight the need to understand social system flexibility to ensure appropriate management and understand the varying impacts of environmental and anthropogenic effects on subpopulations within the same geographic area.},

	abstract = {An individual's ecological environment affects their mortality risk, which in turn has fundamental consequences for life-history evolution. In many species, social relationships are likely to be an important component of an individual's environment, and therefore their mortality risk. Here, we examine the relationship between social position and mortality risk in resident killer whales (Orcinus orca) using over three decades of social and demographic data. We find that the social position of male, but not female, killer whales in their social unit predicts their mortality risk. More socially integrated males have a significantly lower risk of mortality than socially peripheral males, particularly in years of low prey abundance, suggesting that social position mediates access to resources. Male killer whales are larger and require more resources than females, increasing their vulnerability to starvation in years of low salmon abundance. More socially integrated males are likely to have better access to social information and food-sharing opportunities which may enhance their survival in years of low salmon abundance. Our results show that observable variation in the social environment is linked to variation in mortality risk, and highlight how sex differences in social effects on survival may be linked to sex differences in life-history evolution.},

	abstract = {Measures of glucocorticoid stress hormones (e.g. cortisol) have often been used to characterize conflict between subordinates and dominants. In cooperative breeders where subordinates seldom breed in their natal group and assist in offspring rearing, increases in subordinate glucocorticoid levels may be caused by conflict among subordinates as well as by the energetic costs of helping behavior and fluctuations in food availability may exacerbate these effects. During a 6-year study of Kalahari meerkats (Suricata suricatta), we investigated how social, environmental, and individual characteristics influenced subordinate plasma cortisol levels. Subordinate females, who are often the target of aggression from dominant females, had higher cortisol levels when the dominant female in their group was pregnant while the cortisol levels of subordinate males were unaffected by the reproductive state of dominant females. Subordinates of both sexes had higher cortisol levels if they belonged to groups 1) where neither of the dominant breeders in the group were their parents, 2) that contained a high proportion of subordinate females, or 3) that were either very large or very small, especially when the weather was cold and dry. Subordinates in groups containing young pups had higher cortisol levels. Finally, cortisol levels were higher in subordinates of both sexes if they were lighter for their age or had lost little body mass the night prior to sampling. Our results show that both social conflict and cooperative behavior can elevate glucocorticoid levels in subordinates and that both effects can be modified by variation in weather and food availability.},

	abstract = {A universal aspect of mammalian sociality is substantive, core relationships among relatives. Although comparative studies of nonhuman primates have clarified the adaptive importance of kinship, previous research has focused primarily on maternal relatives. To rectify this gap in the literature, recent work has begun to examine the social and adaptive consequences of paternal kinship. However, among multimale-multifemale species, particularly Old World primates, there have been conflicting reports describing the social bonds among paternal relatives. Some researchers have suggested that this inconsistency results from the availability of preferred relatives (maternal kin) as social partners. To explore this hypothesis, we examine the relationship between the availability of kin and sociality among immature olive baboons (Papio hamadryas anubis) by considering the effects that parents have on the social bonds among young maternal and paternal half-siblings. We found that while the presence of a mother in the group did not affect social bonds among immatures, the presence of a father did have a significant impact. Compared to immatures whose fathers were absent from the group, individuals with a father present maintained stronger bonds with paternal half-siblings. These data may help explain some of the variation in previous results among different studies examining the social bonds of half-siblings. Furthermore, our study suggests that the development of relationships among paternal half-siblings is facilitated by fathers and that relationships with paternal kin may be just as critical as those with maternal kin.Significance statementThis study indicates that even in a social system in which matrilineal kinship powerfully influences group structure and dynamics, paternal kinship may nevertheless form the basis of significant selective forces in social evolution.},

	abstract = {* Climate change imposes an urgent need to recognise and conserve the species likely to be worst affected. However, while ecologists have mostly explored indirect effects of rising ambient temperatures on temperate and polar species, physiologists have predicted direct impacts on tropical species.


* The African wild dog (Lycaon pictus), a tropical species, exhibits few of the traits typically used to predict climate change vulnerability. Nevertheless, we predicted that wild dog populations might be sensitive to weather conditions, because the species shows strongly seasonal reproduction across most of its geographical range.


* We explored associations between weather conditions, reproductive costs, and reproductive success, drawing on long-term wild dog monitoring data from sites in Botswana (20°S, 24 years), Kenya (0°N, 12 years), and Zimbabwe (20°S, 6 years).


* High ambient temperatures were associated with reduced foraging time, especially during the energetically costly pup-rearing period. Across all three sites, packs which reared pups at high ambient temperatures produced fewer recruits than did those rearing pups in cooler weather; at the non-seasonal Kenya site such packs also had longer inter-birth intervals. Over time, rising ambient temperatures at the (longest-monitored) Botswana site coincided with falling wild dog recruitment.


* Our findings suggest a direct impact of high ambient temperatures on African wild dog demography, indicating that this species, which is already globally endangered, may be highly vulnerable to climate change. This vulnerability would have been missed by simplistic trait-based assessments, highlighting the limitations of such assessments. Seasonal reproduction, which is less common at low latitudes than at higher latitudes, might be a useful indicator of climate change vulnerability among tropical species.},

Here we develop the first mechanistic model focused on the temporal dynamics of home range expansion and contraction in territorial animals. We demonstrate how simple movement principles can lead to a rich suite of range size dynamics, by balancing foraging activity with defensive requirements and incorporating optimal behavioral rules into mechanistic home range analysis. Our heuristic model predicts three general temporal patterns that have been observed in empirical studies across multiple taxa. First, a positive correlation between age and territory quality promotes shrinking home ranges over an individual’s lifetime, with maximal range size variability shortly before the adult stage. Second, poor sensory information, low population density, and large resource heterogeneity may all independently facilitate range size instability. Finally, aggregation behavior toward forage-rich areas helps produce divergent home range responses between individuals from different age classes. This model has broad applications for addressing important unknowns in animal space use, with potential applications also in conservation and health management strategies.},

However, species do not live in isolation within their physical environments, and direct effects of climate change are likely to be compounded by indirect effects that result from altered interactions with other species, such as competitors and predators. The Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology 2017 Symposium “Indirect Effects of Global Change: From Physiological and Behavioral Mechanisms to Ecological Consequences” was designed to synthesize multiple approaches to investigating the indirect effects of global change by bringing together researchers that study the indirect effects of global change from multiple perspectives across habitat, type of anthropogenic change, and level of biological organization. Our goal in bringing together researchers from different backgrounds was to foster cross-disciplinary insights into the mechanistic bases and higher-order ecological consequences of indirect effects of global change, and to promote collaboration among fields.},

Addressing this challenge is difficult because environmental change can generate both population-level plastic and evolutionary responses, with plastic responses being either adaptive or nonadaptive. We develop an approach that links quantitative genetic theory with data-driven structured models to allow prediction of population responses to environmental change via plasticity and adaptive evolution. After introducing general new theory, we construct a number of example models to demonstrate that evolutionary responses to environmental change over the short-term will be considerably slower than plastic responses and that the rate of adaptive evolution to a new environment depends on whether plastic responses are adaptive or nonadaptive. Parameterization of the models we develop requires information on genetic and phenotypic variation and demography that will not always be available, meaning that simpler models will often be required to predict responses to environmental change. We consequently develop a method to examine whether the full machinery of the evolutionarily explicit models we develop will be needed to predict responses to environmental change or whether simpler nonevolutionary models that are now widely constructed may be sufficient.},

	abstract = {Social complexity has been invoked as a driving force shaping communicative and cognitive abilities, and brain evolution more generally. Despite progress in the conceptual understanding of societal structures, there is still a dearth of quantitative measures to capture social complexity. Here we offer a method to quantify social complexity in terms of the diversity of differentiated relationships. We illustrate our approach using data collected from Barbary macaques, Macaca sylvanus, at ‘La Forêt des Singes’ in Rocamadour, France, as well as simulated data sets for a proof-of-concept. Based on affiliative and agonistic behavioural categories, we calculated four indices that characterize social relationships (diversity of behavioural patterns, dyadic composite sociality index, relative interaction frequency and tenor). Using cluster analyses, we identified four different relationship types: rarely interacting agonistic dyads, rarely interacting affiliative dyads, moderately frequently interacting ambivalent dyads and frequently interacting affiliative dyads. We then calculated for each individual a derived diversity score that integrates information about the number and diversity of relationships each subject maintained. At the individual level, one may be interested to identify predictors of this individual diversity score, such as age, rank or sex. At the group level, variation in the relative shares of affiliative and agonistic interactions affects the distribution of individual diversity scores more than the interaction frequency, while the omission of ambivalent relationships (i.e. a discontinuous variation in the share of affiliative or agonistic relationships) leads to greater variation in diversity scores. The number of realized relationships had only a moderate effect. Overall, this method appears to be suited to capture social complexity in terms of the diversity of relationships at the individual and group level. We suggest that this approach is applicable across different species and facilitates quantitative tests of putative drivers in brain evolution.},

Nonrandom dispersal in the company of allies appears to benefit young males by minimizing the risk of predation and reducing the probability of attack by resident males and females. Nonrandom dispersal also decreases the likelihood of mating with close female kin. Persistent nonrandom transfer, however, increases the risk of inbreeding depression. We emphasize the importance of considering social, as well as genetic, factors when evaluating the costs and benefits of any pattern of dispersal. In certain cases, there may be social advantages to a particular dispersal pattern even though it appears initially to carry some genetic costs. In other cases, a dispersal pattern that at first appears to increase the risk of inbreeding may in fact permit individuals to avoid mating with close kin. Finally, the benefits of a given pattern of dispersal may change markedly during an individual's life. While males seem to benefit by transferring nonrandomly with their peers when young, it may be more advantageous for older males to disperse alone. Age-related changes in the social benefits of nonrandom transfer appear to have important genetic consequences for the population as a whole.},

	abstract = {Via the current model on the evolutionary ecology of female social relationships, Sterck et al. (1997) argue that ecological conditions determine how competition over food resources affects female fitness. The relative importance of different modes of competition then affects female social relationships and dispersal patterns. I outline the model and review relevant data. There are 3 modes of feeding competition: within-group scramble (WGS), within-group contest (WGC), and between-group contest (BGC), which occur in various combinations in different populations of nonhuman primates. Ecological measures support predictions that limiting resources lead to WGS and clumped resources induce WGC. The ecological basis of BGC remains elusive, but it is probably linked to resource abundance. Tests of the proxies of feeding competition support the idea that short-term search substrates and increasing group size lead to WGS, while high-quality patches of intermediate size relative to group size lead to WGC. However, when tested across populations, independent measures of aggression rates do not always match the actual or presumed competitive regimes. This mismatch might be explained by confounding factors and the predominately indirect measures of feeding competition. Predicted relationships between feeding competition and female social relationships/dispersal are only partly supported. This might be attributed to the fact that few studies have taken ultimate approaches using mechanistic correlates of fitness (net energy gain) or lifetime reproductive success to measure consequences of feeding competition. But to resolve existing inconsistencies, additional factors need to be taken into account as well, for example, male sexual strategies may affect female feeding competition; constraints on group size may enforce female dispersal; and demography may alter rates of alliances. More explicitly, ultimate approaches are needed to test the consistency of the socioecological model.},

We find that alternative dispersal patterns, for example among gorillas or gibbons, could explain the findings of related or natal males in a confined geographic area. Based on sexual size dimorphism, we speculate that gorillas might currently be the best model for reconstructing dispersal in robust australopiths. Given that the sexual size dimorphism in other australopiths is still hotly debated, the question of which hominoid model best matches their dispersal pattern must remain unanswered. Neandertal dispersal patterns have been compared to patrilocality of modern humans. However, the latter is related to the advent of food production. Consequently, hunter-gatherers exhibiting primarily multilocality appear to be the better comparison for Neandertals. Overall, human-like patrilocality and Pan-like male philopatry appear to be poor models for the reconstruction of dispersal patterns in Plio-Pleistocene hominins. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In contrast to other populations, and assumptions on folivorous primates, the females of this population exhibit a linear dominance hierarchy. The langurs concentrated their feeding on three key resources with a low density and clumped distribution. Two out of the three key resources contained significantly higher levels of extractable protein and soluble sugar than other food plants, indicating high spatial variability of food quality. Even the mature leaves of the most preferred food plant were about twice as nutritious as those from other food plants. Group spread was small and only a single high-quality resource was used at a time. Finally, even rich resources could accommodate only a subset of a group. These findings fit predictions made for the prevalence of within-group contest competition. Given the observed food distribution and phytochemical heterogeneity of mature foliage, even females of folivorous species should contest for food. The effect of female dominance rank on size and composition of feeding parties also agrees with this prediction. A comparison with data from another forest population, where female dominance relations are weakly developed, revealed a clear-cut difference in the use and abundance of resources. It is argued that between-population differences in female social relationships within a species may be viewed as adaptive responses to local habitat conditions.},

	abstract = {Altruism poses a problem for evolutionary biologists because natural selection is not expected to favor behaviors that are beneficial to recipients, but costly to actors. The theory of kin selection, first articulated by Hamilton (1964), provides a solution to the problem. Hamilton's well-known rule (br {\textgreater} c) provides a simple algorithm for the evolution of altruism via kin selection. Because kin recognition is a crucial requirement of kin selection, it is important to know whether and how primates can recognize their relatives. While conventional wisdom has been that primates can recognize maternal kin, but not paternal kin, this view is being challenged by new findings. The ability to recognize kin implies that kin selection may shape altruistic behavior in primate groups. I focus on two cases in which kin selection is tightly woven into the fabric of social life. For female baboons, macaques, and vervets maternal kinship is an important axis of social networks, coalitionary activity, and dominance relationships. Detailed studies of the patterning of altruistic interactions within these species illustrate the extent and limits of nepotism in their social lives. Carefully integrated analyses of behavior, demography, and genetics among red howlers provide an independent example of how kin selection shapes social organization and behavior. In red howlers, kin bonds shape the life histories and reproductive performance of both males and female. The two cases demonstrate that kin selection can be a powerful source of altruistic activity within primate groups. However, to fully assess the role of kin selection in primate groups, we need more information about the effects of kinship on the patterning of behavior across the Primates and accurate information about paternal kin relationships.},

	abstract = {Individuals that disperse may leave familiar conspecifics (social dispersal), a familiar home range (locational dispersal), or both. Social and locational dispersal are not necessarily coincident in group-living animals. Here we differentiate among some potential costs of both social and locational dispersal in group-living mammals, including aggression from strangers and unfamiliarity with new habitats. As an example of the utility of distinguishing between social and locational dispersal, we examine patterns of female transfer in Old and New World anthropoid primates. The results suggest that in Old World primates, female transfer is more likely to be frequent in populations without female aggression between groups. In anthropoid primates, female transfer is more likely to be frequent in populations in which home ranges of groups overlap extensively with those of other groups. Female transfer between groups in Old World, but not New World, primates appears to be more common when females suffer few or no costs of social and locational dispersal. We suggest that when there are few, if any, costs of social and locational dispersal (inferred from moderate to extensive home range overlap and the absence of aggression between groups of females), female transfer in Old World anthropoids will be obligate when groups of females cannot be monopolized by a single male and conditional upon the behavior of individual males when groups of females can be monopolized by a single male. When costs of social and locational dispersal exist (inferred from minimal home range overlap and aggression between groups of females), female transfer will be conditional upon competition with other females in their groups.},

	abstract = {Sociality is the primary behavioral adaptation of the anthropoid primates, the monkeys and apes. All of the anthropoid primates, except orangutans, spend most of their lives in stable groups of familiar individuals. Ecological factors influence the evolution of sociality, as group living is thought to enhance access to food resources and/or reduces vulnerability to predation. Ecological factors, such as the abundance and distribution of food resources, also shape behavioral strategies of group members, particularly females whose fitness depends largely on their nutritional status. For example, many species of Old World primates feed on fruit and other clumped resources. It is believed that competition over these resources favors the formation of coalitionary alliances among females, and this in turn favors female philopatry and the formation of corporate matrilineal dominance hierarchies. However, while the distribution of food explains many aspects of social organization, other factors may also influence the size and composition of primate groups. Thus, the number of males in primate groups is a joint function of the number of females in the group and the risk of predation. Moreover, many of the Old World monkey species have very similar social organizations although they now live in very different habitats, suggesting that social organization may be highly conservative. Finally, social organization may be shaped by strictly social factors, including the risk of infanticide. Thus, primate social organization may reflect the combined effects of ecological constraints, social pressures, and phylogenetic history.},

	abstract = {Coalitionary support in agonistic interactions is generally thought to be costly to the actor and beneficial to the recipient. Explanations for such cooperative interactions usually invoke kin selection, reciprocal altruism or mutualism. We evaluated the role of these factors and individual benefits in shaping the pattern of coalitionary activity among adult female savannah baboons, Papio cynocephalus, in Amboseli, Kenya. There is a broad consensus that, when ecological conditions favour collective defence of resources, selection favours investment in social relationships with those likely to provide coalitionary support. The primary features of social organization in female-bonded groups, including female philopatry, linear dominance hierarchies, acquisition of maternal rank and well-differentiated female relationships, are thought to be functionally linked to the existence of alliances between females. Female savannah baboons display these characteristics, but the frequency and function of their coalitionary aggression is disputed. In our five study groups, 4–6\% of all disputes between females led to intervention by third parties. Adult females selectively supported close maternal kin. There was no evidence that females traded grooming for support or reciprocated support with nonkin. High-ranking females participated in coalitionary aggression most frequently, perhaps because they derived more benefits from group membership than other females did or could provide support at lower cost. Females typically supported the higher ranking of two contestants when they intervened in disputes between subordinates, so most coalitions reinforced the existing dominance hierarchy. Results indicate that female baboons participate in coalitionary aggression in a manner strongly influenced by nepotism and individual benefits.},

Here, we examine the relationship between social capital and fecal glucocorticoid (GC) levels in pregnant free-ranging adult female rhesus macaques. In addition to social capital measures based on direct connections between social partners, which have been examined previously, we use social network analysis to generate measures of social capital based on indirect connections (i.e. connections between pairs of individuals which result from their mutual direct connection to a third party). We consider social capital based on three different types of affiliative association: grooming, the exchange of affiliative vocalizations and proximity. After controlling for variables known to affect GC output in primates (e.g. month of pregnancy), GC levels of females were significantly predicted by a social network measure of indirect connectedness in the proximity network, proximity reach, in interaction with dominance rank. High ranking females had significantly lower GC levels in months in which they had low levels of proximity reach (i.e. in months in which their proximity networks were smaller and therefore more focused).

	abstract = {Social networks show striking structural regularities, and both theory and evidence suggest that networks may have facilitated the development of large-scale cooperation in humans. Here, we characterize the social networks of the Hadza, a population of hunter-gatherers in Tanzania. We show that Hadza networks have important properties also seen in modernized social networks, including a skewed degree distribution, degree assortativity, transitivity, reciprocity, geographic decay and homophily. We demonstrate that Hadza camps exhibit high between-group and low within-group variation in public goods game donations. Network ties are also more likely between people who give the same amount, and the similarity in cooperative behaviour extends up to two degrees of separation. Social distance appears to be as important as genetic relatedness and physical proximity in explaining assortativity in cooperation. Our results suggest that certain elements of social network structure may have been present at an early point in human history. Also, early humans may have formed ties with both kin and non-kin, based in part on their tendency to cooperate. Social networks may thus have contributed to the emergence of cooperation.},

	abstract = {The social system of spider monkeys is characterized by female dispersal and fission–fusion social organization. After emigration from a natal group, a female spider monkey is expected to experience variation in their reproductive status, which may in turn be expected to alter association patterns within the new group. Until now, analyses on association patterns in spider monkeys have most often been studied on an annual basis, but such time-constrained analyses may bury long-term patterns of association and potential variation across multiple reproductive cycles. In this study, I examine the variation of female association in relation with her reproductive status through social network analysis in three relatively short-term periods of 2–3 months each across several years. Network analysis showed clear clusters for each sex, but there was variation among periods. Lactating females were always central, and cycling females were always drawn outside of their core network. Pregnant and possibly cycling females, and a lone immigrant female, were typically peripheral in other females’ cluster. Two metrics – both eigenvector centrality and network strength – were affected by females’ reproductive status, which were highest in lactating females and lowest in cycling females. Although initially peripheral in the network, a young immigrant female subsequently became the center of a female cluster upon giving birth to a baby, one and a half years after immigrating. Short-term network analysis was useful to explain the variation of roles an individual plays in fission–fusion social organization.},

	abstract = {Although gorillas live in a wide range of habitats with varying degrees of frugivory, all of their populations exhibit female dispersal that characterizes many non-female-bonded social groups of folivores. Natal dispersal is common for gorillas, but inbreeding avoidance did not seem to explain which females transferred among the Virunga mountain gorillas. Analyses of secondary transfers gave no indication that feeding competition limits the group size of western gorillas or mountain gorillas, although group size appears to be more constrained in western gorillas. As a result, western gorillas may be an example of the original folivore paradox: if the costs of feeding competition are insignificant, then why are females remaining in smaller groups, despite predictions of higher predation risks? Mountain gorillas no longer have natural predators, but they may be an example of a second folivore paradox: why do 50–60 \% of females live in smaller one-male groups, despite a higher risk of infanticide? Transfers by female mountain gorillas did not show a consistent preference for multimale groups. A mathematical model and empirical results from western gorillas suggest that variability in male quality may resolve both paradoxes. In addition, the influence of infanticide may vary considerably among gorilla populations. Preliminary analyses showed little evidence of any cost of dispersal by mountain gorillas in the Virungas. The lack of such costs may help to explain why dispersal is common among gorilla populations, even if the benefits are not yet fully apparent.},

Intergroup transfers occurred throughout the year independent of season. A total of 613 focal samples of 10-min duration conducted on six adolescent females (5–9 years of age) revealed significant differences in the behavior of migrant versus natal resident females. During the seasons encompassing their respective group transfers, both emigrants and immigrants devoted more of their time to resting than resident females belonging to the same age cohorts did. Time spent feeding on mature fruit was higher for one emigrant and lower for both immigrants compared to the two resident females. Emigrant females had fewer neighbors within a 1-m radius than resident females did, whereas immigrant females were within a 1-m radius of adult females and within a 5-m radius of adult males more often than resident adolescent females were. Adolescent females were displaced on 26 occasions. Displacements occurred mainly during the dry seasons (n = 21) and mainly at food sources (n = 21). Using the number of focal samples conducted on each female as an estimate of observation time, immigrant females were displaced at twice the rate of residents. However, like other behavioral differences detected between resident and migrant adolescent females, differences in individual displacement rates were evident only during the season in which each of the immigrants joined the group. Collectively, our findings imply that female intergroup transfer in this population involves relatively mild, short-term costs.},

It provides an unparalleled compilation of information on taxonomy, genetics, vocalizations, demography, social organization, dispersal, social behavior, reproduction, mortality factors, diet, ranging patterns, interspecific relations, and conservation. Social relationships in red colobus are less rigidly structured than in other African monkeys, resulting in considerable variation in social organization and group composition, both within and between taxa. This provides a unique opportunity to examine the extent to which social variables correlate with differences in habitat quality, demography, and predation by chimpanzees and humans. Unfortunately, at least half of the 18 taxa of red colobus are now threatened with extinction. Conservation problems are described, causal factors identified, and solutions proposed. This volume is intended not only to serve as a reference book, but to stimulate and guide future long-term research and to encourage effective conservation action.},

We analyze such a campaign in the Peruvian Amazon, where more than 1,200 indigenous communities comprising some 11 million ha have been titled since the mid-1970s. We use community-level longitudinal data derived from high-resolution satellite images to estimate the effect of titling between 2002 and 2005 on contemporaneous forest clearing and disturbance. Our results indicate that titling reduces clearing by more than three-quarters and forest disturbance by roughly two-thirds in a 2-y window spanning the year title is awarded and the year afterward.

We present a revised aridity index for quantifying water deficit (WD) in terrestrial environments using tooth enamel δ18O values, and use this approach to address paleoaridity over the past 4.4 million years in eastern Africa. We find no long-term trend in WD, consistent with other terrestrial climate indicators in the Omo-Turkana Basin, and no relationship between paleoaridity and herbivore paleodiet structure among fossil collections meeting the criteria for WD estimation. Thus, we suggest that changes in the abundance of C4 grass and grazing herbivores in eastern Africa during the Pliocene and Pleistocene may have been decoupled from aridity. As in modern African ecosystems, other factors, such as rainfall seasonality or ecological interactions among plants and mammals, may be important for understanding the evolution of C4 grass- and grazer-dominated biomes.},

	abstract = {In most mammals, female fertility and reproduction are strongly influenced by nutritional status and, therefore, by foraging conditions. Here, we investigate the relationship between food resources, feeding competition, energy intake and reproduction in a group of wild female Assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis) in northeastern Thailand. Over 2,100 h of data on feeding behaviour, energy intake and activity budgets were combined with data on resource characteristics, female reproduction and physical condition. We found that an increase in food availability had a positive effect on female energy intake and conception rates. In addition, it appeared that females incurred energetic costs during lactation and that females with a better physical condition during the mating season were more likely to conceive. The annual birth season occurred a few months before the annual peak in food availability, causing peak lactation to coincide with a period of high food availability. This suggests that females use the increased food abundance to compensate for the energetic costs of lactation. Neither energy intake rates nor activity budgets were influenced by female dominance rank, even during periods when the levels of contest competition were predicted to be high. In line with this, we found no evidence for rank-related differences in reproduction. The apparently limited influence of feeding competition in female Assamese macaques adds to the debate on the extent to which patterns in feeding competition and fitness can reliably be predicted based on ecological conditions. We suggest that this may partially be resolved by including potential competition-reducing mechanisms into the predictive framework.},

	abstract = {In most social mammals, members of either one sex or both leave their natal group at sexual maturity. In catarrhine primates, male emigration is the predominant pattern. Female philopatry facilitates cooperation among kin, and female reproductive success is influenced by these relationships. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are unusual in that dispersal is almost exclusively by females. While plausible ultimate hypotheses can explain this dispersal pattern, the proximate causes of female dispersal are unknown and warrant examination due to variation in dispersal behaviour and the associated high costs of immigration. In this study, we examine the behavioural and hormonal context of female dispersal in chimpanzees of Kibale National Park, Uganda, in order to understand variation in dispersal patterns and gain insight into functional explanations. Using over 10 years of behavioural, endocrinological, and demographic records, we examined the significance of 5 potential predictors of the timing of dispersal: (1) maturational state; (2) association patterns; (3) mating patterns; (4) physiological stress; and (5) feeding ecology. Female dispersal was not strictly predicted by chronological or gynaecological age, and dispersal did not correlate with shifts in glucocorticoid levels. We found no evidence that females avoided mating in their natal group, even with known relatives, suggesting that inbreeding avoidance is not a sufficient proximate explanation for dispersal in chimpanzees. Instead, variation in social development and the availability of energy for dispersal were implicated and necessitate more intensive examination along with subtler variation in maturational trajectories.},

	abstract = {Humans and other primates are distinct among placental mammals in having exceptionally slow rates of growth, reproduction, and aging. Primates’ slow life history schedules are generally thought to reflect an evolved strategy of allocating energy away from growth and reproduction and toward somatic investment, particularly to the development and maintenance of large brains. Here we examine an alternative explanation: that primates’ slow life histories reflect low total energy expenditure (TEE) (kilocalories per day) relative to other placental mammals. We compared doubly labeled water measurements of TEE among 17 primate species with similar measures for other placental mammals. We found that primates use remarkably little energy each day, expending on average only 50\% of the energy expected for a placental mammal of similar mass. Such large differences in TEE are not easily explained by differences in physical activity, and instead appear to reflect systemic metabolic adaptation for low energy expenditures in primates. Indeed, comparisons of wild and captive primate populations indicate similar levels of energy expenditure. Broad interspecific comparisons of growth, reproduction, and maximum life span indicate that primates’ slow metabolic rates contribute to their characteristically slow life histories.},

	abstract = {Understanding the costs and regulation of reproduction in primates requires understanding the separate but linked effects of energy availability and total energy expenditure (TEE). We compared variation in TEE and energy intake (EI) between two periods, early lactation and after the resumption of sexual cycling, for eight females from two groups of normally reproducing colony-living baboons (Papio h. anubis). Total energy expenditure was assessed using the doubly labeled water method. TEE was correlated with maternal mass both during early lactation and after the resumption of cycling. TEE after the resumption of cycling was positively related to infant growth rates; mothers with rapidly growing infants had higher energy expenditure. TEE was however unrelated to maternal rank and only weakly associated with reproductive parameters such as delay to conception. EI in early lactation was related to infant mass and interbirth intervals, but unrelated to infant growth or reproductive parameters once cycling had resumed. Energy availability (EA; the difference between intake and expenditure) differed significantly between subordinate and dominant females during early lactation, was highly variable among individuals as a function of body composition, and is suggested to follow a nonlinear relationship as a complex function of social status, lactation stage, infant growth, and female fertility. Thus, as a consequence of reduced energy availability, subordinate females in this captive context may experience reproductive delays even though the total energy expenditure after the return of cycling was similar between high and low ranking females.

	abstract = {Dispersal is a major life history trait of social organisms influencing the behavioral and genetic structure of their groups. Unfortunately, primate dispersal is difficult to quantify, because of the rarity of these events and our inability to ascertain if individuals dispersed or died when they disappear. Socioecological models have been partially developed to understand the ecological causes of different dispersal systems and their social consequences. However, these models have yielded confusing results when applied to folivores. The folivorous red colobus monkey (Procolobus rufomitratus) in Kibale National Park, Uganda is thought to exhibit female-biased dispersal, although both sexes have been observed to disperse and there remains considerable debate over the selective pressures favoring the transfers of males and females and the causes of variation in the proportion of each sex to leave the natal group. We circumvent this problem by using microsatellite DNA data to investigate the prediction that female dispersal will be more frequent in larger groups as compared to smaller ones. The rationale for this prediction is that red colobus exhibit increased within-group competition in bigger groups, which should favor higher female dispersal rates and ultimately lower female relatedness. Genetic data from two unequally sized neighboring groups of red colobus demonstrate increased female relatedness within the smaller group, suggesting females are less likely to disperse when there is less within-group competition. We suggest that the dispersal system is mediated to some degree by scramble competition and group size. Since red colobus group sizes have increased throughout Kibale by over 50\% in the last decade, these changes may have major implications for the genetic structure and ultimately the population viability of this endangered primate.

However, neither explanation has been tested against quantitative comparisons. Here, we use quantitative comparisons and phylogenetic reconstructions to show that contrasts in female philopatry in plural breeders are associated with the risk that a female’s father is reproductively active in her group when she starts to breed, supporting the suggestion that habitual female dispersal has evolved to minimize the risk of inbreeding.},

	abstract = {Female dispersal occurs in a number of primate species. It may be related to: avoidance of inbreeding, reduction in food competition, reduction of predation risk, or avoidance of infanticide in combination with mate choice. Female dispersal was studied for a 5-year period in a wild population of Thomas langurs (Presbytis thomasi) that lived in one-male multi-female groups. Juvenile and adult individuals of both sexes were seen to disperse. Females appeared to transfer unhindered between groups, mostly from a larger group to a recently formed smaller one. They transferred without their infants and when not pregnant, and seemed to transfer preferentially during periods when extra-group males were harassing their group. During these inter-group encounters extra-group males seemed to try to commit infanticide. Thus, the timing of female transfer was probably closely linked to infanticide avoidance. Moreover, females seemed to transfer when the resident male of their group was no longer a good protector. The observations in the present study suggest that females transferred to reduce the risk of infanticide. Female dispersal may have another ultimate advantage as well, namely inbreeding avoidance. Due to the dispersal of both females and males the social organization of Thomas langurs was rather fluid. New groups were formed when females joined a male; male takeovers were not observed. Bisexual groups had only a limited life span, because all adult females of a bisexual group could emigrate. This pattern of unhindered female dispersal affects male reproductive strategies, and in particular it might lead to infanticidal behavior during inter-group encounters. Am. J.

	abstract = {* In a previous article, we advocated against using the sum of Akaike weights (SW) as a metric to distinguish between genuine and spurious variables in Information Theoretic (IT) statistical analyses. A recent article (Giam and Olden 2016 Methods in Ecology and Evolution 7:388-397) criticizes our finding and instead argues in favor of SW. It points out that (i) we performed a biased data-generation procedure and (ii) we erroneously evaluated SW on its capacity to estimate the proportion of variance in the data explained by a variable. We here respond to these points.


* Giam and Olden's first concern is unfounded. When using the data-generating code they proposed, SW remains very imprecise. To respond to their second concern, we first list the meanings taken by a variable's importance in the context of IT. Although SW is presented as an estimate of variable relative importance in methodological textbooks (i.e. a variable's rank in importance or its relative contribution to the variance in the data), it is also used as a metric of variable absolute importance (i.e. a variable's absolute effect size or its statistical significance). We then compare SW to alternative metrics on its ability to estimate variable absolute or relative importance.


* SW values have low repeatability across analyses. As a result, based on SW, it is hard to distinguish between variables with weak and large effects. For estimations of variable absolute importance, experimenters should prefer model-averaged parameter estimates and/or compare nested models based on evidence ratios. SW is also a poor metric of variable relative importance. We showed that correct variable ranking in importance was generally more frequent when using model-averaged standardized parameter estimates, than when using SW.


* To avoid recurrent errors in ecology and evolution, we therefore warn against the use of SW for estimations of variable absolute and relative importance and we propose that experimenters instead use model-averaged standardized parameter estimates to base their statistical inferences.

Although female dispersal is not the typical pattern for Cercopithecidae, reports of male-philopatric/female-dispersal or both-sex-dispersal social systems have increased in Colobinae. Therefore, comparisons among colobine species with various dispersal patterns may provide insight on the influence of dispersal pattern differences on their social relationships. Here, we report the results of the first quantitative comparison of the proportion of time spent grooming by colobines and of the interindividual relationships within units among colobines based on grooming networks. We found that variations in the proportion of time spent grooming across colobine species were mostly explained by the classical group-cohesion model proposed by Dunbar (1991), i.e. group size is the most important factor with a positive effect. This indicates that colobines must spend a higher proportion of their time grooming to maintain cohesion of their larger social group. Although individual colobine dispersal patterns had no significant effect on the proportion of time spent grooming, the social network analysis indicated that the interindividual relationship differences across six species and the mechanisms underlying cohesion of units were affected by their dispersal patterns. Our findings provide insight into the colobine society, such as the effect of group size and individual dispersal patterns on grooming.},

This pattern did not change after the abandonment of artificial provisioning. We then present two new cases of immigrant females, focusing especially on social association patterns, dominance relationships, and affiliative interactions during the approximate 2.5 years from the time of their immigration to their first birth. These females began engaging in social grooming with resident females immediately after their arrival but rarely did so with adult males, suggesting that they regard social bonding with females as more important than that with males. They also emigrated at a young age and frequently engaged in social play. Indeed, social bonding established through frequent social play may be related to the development of socially symmetrical relationships, which are the basis for the egalitarian bonobo society. Intragroup competition for food and mates was unlikely explanations for the tendency toward female dispersal. However, male residence and the risk of father–daughter incest may encourage female transfer among bonobos.},

We investigate the link between dispersal, the kin composition of groups, and proximity patterns in a population of black-and-white colobus (Colobus vellerosus) that shows variation in female dispersal. From 2006 to 2011, we collected behavioral data, demographic data, and fecal samples of 77 males and 92 females residing in eight groups at Boabeng-Fiema, Ghana. A combination of demographic data and a genetic network analysis showed that although philopatry was female-biased, only about half of the females resided in their natal groups. Only one group contained female-female dyads with higher average relatedness than randomly drawn animals of both sexes from the same group. Despite between-group variation in female dispersal and kin composition, female-female dyads in most of the study groups had higher proximity scores than randomly drawn dyads from the same group. We conclude that groups fall along a continuum from female dispersed, not kin-based, and not bonded to female philopatric, kin-based, and bonded. We found only partial support for the predicted link between dispersal, kin composition, and social relationships. In contrast to most mammals where the kin composition of groups is a good predictor of the quality of female-female relationships, this study provides further support for the notion that kinship is not necessary for the development and maintenance of social bonds in some gregarious species.},

	abstract = {Female social dispersal in primates differs from the general mammalian pattern of locational dispersal. Both nulliparous and parous females may disperse to another group. Several hypotheses can explain female social dispersal: reduction of predation risk, inbreeding avoidance, and offspring protection through mate choice. We tested these hypotheses with an extended data set of Thomas langurs (Presbytis thomasi) and investigated parameters of male behaviour that females may use in their dispersal decisions. Data were collected over a 12.5-year period from a wild population in Sumatra, Indonesia, allowing for some critical tests of the hypotheses. Females dispersed to a group smaller than their original one, thereby refuting the predation risk hypothesis. Maturing nulliparous females only dispersed when their father was resident. Therefore, dispersal by nulliparous females was best explained through inbreeding avoidance. Parous females transferred to young, adult males. These males provided better protection to offspring against predation and infanticide than the old, late tenure males. Therefore, females transfer to better protector males. The male behavioural cues that females use to assess male quality were unclear. Females, however, may use proxies of male age, such as group composition and acoustical characteristics of loud calls, as indicators of male quality. The results suggest that female mate choice is an important function of social dispersal by parous females. Its importance in locational dispersal remains to be investigated.},

	abstract = {In 1963, Jeanne and Stuart Altmann traveled through Kenya and Tanzania searching for a baboon study site. They settled on the Maasai-Amboseli Game Reserve (later Amboseli National Park) and conducted a 13-month study that laid the groundwork for much future research. They returned for a short visit in 1969, and came again in July 1971 to establish a research project that has persisted for four decades. In July 1984 Susan Alberts joined the field team, later becoming a graduate student and eventually a director. Over the years, we have tackled research questions ranging from feeding ecology to behavioral endocrinology, from kin recognition to sexual selection, and from aging research to functional genetics. A number of our results have explicitly depended upon the longitudinal nature of the research. Without decades worth of individual-based data we would not have known, for instance, that the presence of fathers influenced the maturation rates of their offspring, that maternal dominance rank had pervasive effects on the physiology of sons, or that the social behavior of a female influenced her infants’ survival. Here we summarize the major research themes that have characterized each of the past four decades, and our directions for the future, emphasizing the scientific insights that the longitudinal nature of the study has made possible.},

	abstract = {The study of comparative energetics offers a valuable way to identify broad ecological principles and assess the functional significance of energetic adaptations during the course of evolution. Yet, the quantification of energetic status for nonhuman primates under natural conditions remains one of the most challenging aspects of comparative energetics research. Here, we report on the development of a noninvasive field method for measuring energetic status in great apes, humans, and possibly other nonhuman primates. Specifically, we have explored measurement of a urinary metabolite of insulin (C-peptide) as a physiological marker of energetic condition in chimpanzees and orangutans. We performed three validation studies and successfully measured C-peptide in urine samples from captive chimpanzees, wild chimpanzees, and wild orangutans. Urinary C-peptide measures gave indications of being a reliable signal of energetic status in both species. For chimpanzees and orangutans in the wild, baseline urinary C-peptide levels were higher during periods of fruit abundance than periods of low fruit availability. Urinary C-peptide levels were also higher for well-fed captive chimpanzees compared with wild chimpanzees. Although sample size was small, top-ranking male chimpanzees showed higher C-peptide levels in the wild than low-ranking males only during the period of fruit abundance. These preliminary results indicate that further development of the urinary C-peptide method could expand opportunities to quantify energetic condition for great apes in the wild and generate new data for comparative research. We highlight specific applications for studying great ape reproduction as well as the nutritional ecology of human foragers. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2007. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Female mountain gorillas are interesting subjects to examine environmental correlates of energy balance because their diet is primarily herbaceous vegetation, their food supply shows little seasonal variation and is abundant, yet they live in cooler, high-altitude habitats that may bring about energetic challenges. Social and reproductive parameters may also influence energy balance. Urinary C-peptide (UCP) has emerged as a valuable non-invasive biomarker of energy balance in primates. Here we use this method to investigate factors influencing energy balance in mountain gorillas of the Virunga Volcanoes, Rwanda. We examined a range of socioecological variables on energy balance in adult females in three groups monitored by the Karisoke Research Center over nine months. Three variables had significant effects on UCP levels: habitat (highest levels in the bamboo zone), season (highest levels in November during peak of the bamboo shoot availability) and day time (gradually increasing from early morning to early afternoon). There was no significant effect of reproductive state and dominance rank. Our study indicates that even in species that inhabit an area with a seemingly steady food supply, ecological variability can have pronounced effects on female energy balance.},

C-peptide is produced on an equimolar basis with insulin, thus is indicative of the body's response to available glucose and, with repeated measurement, provides a biomarker of energy balance. As yet, few studies have validated the efficacy of C-peptide for monitoring energy balance in wild animals. Here, we assess seasonal and interindividual variation in urinary C-peptide concentrations of East African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). We assayed 519 urine samples from 13 adult male chimpanzees in the Kanyawara community of Kibale National Park, Uganda. C-peptide levels were significantly predicted by the total amount of fruit and the amount of preferred fruit in the diet. However, chimpanzees had very low C-peptide titers during an epidemic of severe respiratory illness, despite highly favorable feeding conditions. Kanyawara males had significantly lower C-peptide levels than males at Ngogo, a nearby chimpanzee community occupying a more productive habitat. Among Kanyawara males, low-ranking males had consistently higher C-peptide levels than dominant males. While counterintuitive, this result supports previous findings of costs associated with dominance in male chimpanzees. Our preliminary investigations demonstrate that C-peptide has wide applications in field research, providing an accessible tool for evaluating seasonal and individual variation in energetic condition, as well as the costs of processes such as immune function and reproduction.},

	abstract = {Assessment of energetic condition is a critical tool for behavioral and reproductive ecologists. However, accurate quantification of energy intake and expenditure is labor-intensive, and it can be problematic for field scientists to obtain regular data on individual animals. C-peptide, a polypeptide segment of the proinsulin molecule that is secreted along with insulin in an equimolar relationship, can be measured in urine, and thus offers a potential means for the non-invasive assessment of energy balance in wild animals. Here, we validate C-peptide for the quantification of energetic condition, with specific application to wild orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus). We determined that application of urine to filter paper results in significantly lower C-peptide recoveries versus fresh samples. However, concentrations in filter paper samples were significantly correlated with fresh urine and were stable over various storage conditions and durations. We compared the C-peptide concentrations from wild orangutan urine samples with three independent measures of energetic condition: ketone bodies (urinalysis), caloric intake (nutritional biochemistry), and food availability (phenology). As expected, C-peptide concentrations were significantly lower in samples that tested positive for ketones in the field. Monthly average C-peptide concentrations of both male and female orangutans were significantly correlated with monthly determinations of energy intake and food availability. Therefore, we conclude that the collection and preservation of urine samples for C-peptide analysis are feasible under most field conditions and, in this species, presents a useful tool for assessing changes in energy balance.},

	abstract = {A likely consequence of global warming will be the redistribution of Earth’s rain belts, affecting water availability for many of Earth’s inhabitants. We consider three ways in which planetary warming might influence the global distribution of precipitation. The first possibility is that rainfall in the tropics will increase and that the subtropics and mid-latitudes will become more arid. A second possibility is that Earth’s thermal equator, around which the planet’s rain belts and dry zones are organized, will migrate northward. This northward shift will be a consequence of the Northern Hemisphere, with its large continental area, warming faster than the Southern Hemisphere, with its large oceanic area. A third possibility is that both of these scenarios will play out simultaneously. We review paleoclimate evidence suggesting that (i) the middle latitudes were wetter during the last glacial maximum, (ii) a northward shift of the thermal equator attended the abrupt Bølling-Allerød climatic transition {\textasciitilde}14.6 thousand years ago, and (iii) a southward shift occurred during the more recent Little Ice Age. We also inspect trends in seasonal surface heating between the hemispheres over the past several decades. From these clues, we predict that there will be a seasonally dependent response in rainfall patterns to global warming. During boreal summer, in which the rate of recent warming has been relatively uniform between the hemispheres, wet areas will get wetter and dry regions will become drier. During boreal winter, rain belts and drylands will expand northward in response to differential heating between the hemispheres.
As the planet warms, differential heating between the hemispheres will affect the global distribution of rainfall.

	abstract = {* Understanding how bottom-up and top-down forces affect resource selection can inform restoration efforts. With a global population size of {\textless}500 individuals, the hirola Beatragus hunteri is the world's most endangered antelope, with a declining population since the 1970s. While the underlying mechanisms are unclear, some combination of habitat loss and predation are thought to be responsible for low abundances of contemporary populations.


* Efforts to conserve hirola are hindered by a lack of understanding as to why population density remains low, despite eradication of the viral disease, rinderpest. To elucidate factors underlying chronically low numbers, we examined resource selection and landscape change within the hirola's native range. Because hirola are grazers, we hypothesized that the availability of open areas would be linked both to forage and safety from predators. We quantified: (i) changes in tree cover across the hirola's historical range in eastern Kenya over the past 27 years; (ii) how tree cover has influenced resource selection by hirola; and (iii) interactions between tree cover and predation.


* Between 1985 and 2012, tree cover increased by 251\% across the historical range of hirola. Tree encroachment was associated with a 98\% decline of hirola and elephant Loxodonta africana populations, a 74\% decline in cattle Bos indicus, an increase in browsing livestock by 327\%, and a reduction in rainfall.


* Although hirola avoided tree cover, we found no evidence that predation on hirola increased with increasing tree cover.


* Synthesis and applications. Hirola may qualify as a refugee species, in which contemporary populations are restricted to suboptimal habitat and exhibit low survival, reproduction or both. The extinction of hirola would be the first of a mammalian genus on the African continent in modern history. We conclude that contemporary low numbers of hirola are due at least partly to habitat loss via tree encroachment, triggered by some combination of elephant extirpation, overgrazing, drought and perhaps fire suppression. We recommend a combination of rangeland restoration efforts (including conservation of elephants, manual clearing of trees, and grass seeding), increased enforcement of an existing protected area (Arawale National Reserve), and reintroductions to enhance recovery for this endangered species. These efforts will rely on enhanced support from the international conservation community and the cooperation of pastoralist communities with which the hirola coexist.},

The extent of forest area in dryland habitats, which occupy more than 40\% of Earth's land surface, is uncertain compared with that in other biomes. Bastin et al. provide a global estimate of forest extent in drylands, calculated from high-resolution satellite images covering more than 200,000 plots. Forests in drylands are much more extensive than previously reported and cover a total area similar to that of tropical rainforests or boreal forests. This increases estimates of global forest cover by at least 9\%, a finding that will be important in estimating the terrestrial carbon sink.
Science, this issue p. 635
Dryland biomes cover two-fifths of Earth’s land surface, but their forest area is poorly known. Here, we report an estimate of global forest extent in dryland biomes, based on analyzing more than 210,000 0.5-hectare sample plots through a photo-interpretation approach using large databases of satellite imagery at (i) very high spatial resolution and (ii) very high temporal resolution, which are available through the Google Earth platform. We show that in 2015, 1327 million hectares of drylands had more than 10\% tree-cover, and 1079 million hectares comprised forest. Our estimate is 40 to 47\% higher than previous estimates, corresponding to 467 million hectares of forest that have never been reported before. This increases current estimates of global forest cover by at least 9\%.

Forests worldwide are in a state of flux, with accelerating losses in some regions and gains in others. Hansen et al. (p. 850) examined global Landsat data at a 30-meter spatial resolution to characterize forest extent, loss, and gain from 2000 to 2012. Globally, 2.3 million square kilometers of forest were lost during the 12-year study period and 0.8 million square kilometers of new forest were gained. The tropics exhibited both the greatest losses and the greatest gains (through regrowth and plantation), with losses outstripping gains.
Quantification of global forest change has been lacking despite the recognized importance of forest ecosystem services. In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil’s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.
Landsat data reveals details of forest losses and gains across the globe on an annual basis from 2000 to 2012.

	abstract = {The availability of detailed environmental data, together with inexpensive and powerful computers, has fueled a rapid increase in predictive modeling of species environmental requirements and geographic distributions. For some species, detailed presence/absence occurrence data are available, allowing the use of a variety of standard statistical techniques. However, absence data are not available for most species. In this paper, we introduce the use of the maximum entropy method (Maxent) for modeling species geographic distributions with presence-only data. Maxent is a general-purpose machine learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and it has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modeling. In order to investigate the efficacy of the method, here we perform a continental-scale case study using two Neotropical mammals: a lowland species of sloth, Bradypus variegatus, and a small montane murid rodent, Microryzomys minutus. We compared Maxent predictions with those of a commonly used presence-only modeling method, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP). We made predictions on 10 random subsets of the occurrence records for both species, and then used the remaining localities for testing. Both algorithms provided reasonable estimates of the species’ range, far superior to the shaded outline maps available in field guides. All models were significantly better than random in both binomial tests of omission and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was almost always higher for Maxent, indicating better discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for the species. The Maxent modeling approach can be used in its present form for many applications with presence-only datasets, and merits further research and development.},

These species are often rare and have limited known occurrences, posing challenges for creating accurate species distribution models. We tested four modeling methods (Bioclim, Domain, GARP, and Maxent) across 18 species with different levels of ecological specialization using six different sample size treatments and three different evaluation measures. Our assessment revealed that Maxent was the most capable of the four modeling methods in producing useful results with sample sizes as small as 5, 10 and 25 occurrences. The other methods compensated reasonably well (Domain and GARP) to poorly (Bioclim) when presented with datasets of small sample sizes. We show that multiple evaluation measures are necessary to determine accuracy of models produced with presence-only data. Further, we found that accuracy of models is greater for species with small geographic ranges and limited environmental tolerance, ecological characteristics of many rare species. Our results indicate that reasonable models can be made for some rare species, a result that should encourage conservationists to add distribution modeling to their toolbox.},

	abstract = {Large areas of tropical forests have been converted to agricultural land and subsequently abandoned. If restoration can occur on these abandoned lands, it offers great potential for biodiversity recovery, carbon sequestration, and enhanced ecosystem services. To understand the interaction between different forms of anthropogenic degradation and restoration strategies we examined biomass accumulation at two different scales. First, using small scale comparisons where the tree species pool, climate, and dispersers were similar, we quantified regeneration in degraded sites in Kibale National Park, Uganda subjected to different restoration strategies. Second, we contrasted biomass accumulation for 57 tropical studies where the nature and time since disturbance differed. The above ground biomass of 10–32 year old forest in Kibale ranged from 15,675 to 34,294 kg/ha and was a function of the type of the management strategy used to promote regeneration. The above ground biomass accumulation from other tropical sites ranged extensively; from 470 kg/ha in an 8 year old abandoned pasture in Brazil to 272,000 kg/ha in a 16 year old abandoned agricultural field in Mexico. Overall, the time since abandonment was a good predictor of biomass accumulation. This review demonstrates that once left to regenerate, secondary forests accumulate above ground biomass in a very positive manner; however, the speed of biomass accumulation can be facilitated by site-specific restoration strategies. Both the cost and efficiency of different restoration strategies vary dramatically and our research in Kibale suggests that making larger financial investments does not necessarily result in more positive biomass accumulation.},

Here, we present baseline information on the presence/absence and relative abundance of primate species at the abandoned settlement of the Ekundukundu village, relocated out of the Korup National Park in 2000. Between July 2007 and March 2008, 62 km of transects was surveyed for sightings and calls of primates. All eight species of diurnal primates reported in the KNP were confirmed: Cercopithecus nictitans ludio, C. mona, C. erythrotis camerunensis, C. pogonias, Procolobus pennantii preussi, Cercocebus torquatus, Mandrillus leucophaeus leucophaeus, and Pan troglodytes vellerosus. At old Ekundukundu, C. nictitans accounted for 65\% of all primate group sightings. Overall, sighting frequency of primates (0.55 groups/km) was not significantly different from other park sectors surveyed by a previous observer (J. Linder) in 2004–2005. The data reported here will be useful in the long-term monitoring of primate populations in regenerating forest habitats of earlier human settlements. Am. J.

	abstract = {Protected areas are leading tools in efforts to slow global species loss and appear also to have a role in climate change policy. Understanding their impacts on deforestation informs environmental policies. We review several approaches to evaluating protection's impact on deforestation, given three hurdles to empirical evaluation, and note that “matching” techniques from economic impact evaluation address those hurdles. The central hurdle derives from the fact that protected areas are distributed nonrandomly across landscapes. Nonrandom location can be intentional, and for good reasons, including biological and political ones. Yet even so, when protected areas are biased in their locations toward less-threatened areas, many methods for impact evaluation will overestimate protection's effect. The use of matching techniques allows one to control for known landscape biases when inferring the impact of protection. Applications of matching have revealed considerably lower impact estimates of forest protection than produced by other methods. A reduction in the estimated impact from existing parks does not suggest, however, that protection is unable to lower clearing. Rather, it indicates the importance of variation across locations in how much impact protection could possibly have on rates of deforestation. Matching, then, bundles improved estimates of the average impact of protection with guidance on where new parks’ impacts will be highest. While many factors will determine where new protected areas will be sited in the future, we claim that the variation across space in protection's impact on deforestation rates should inform site choice.},

	abstract = {Vast areas of degraded tropical forest, combined with increasing interest in mitigating climate change and conserving biodiversity, demonstrate the potential value of restoring tropical forest. However, there is a lack of long-term studies assessing active management for restoration. Here we investigate Above-Ground Biomass (AGB), forest structure, and biodiversity, before degradation (in old-growth forest), after degradation (in abandoned agricultural savanna grassland), and within a forest that is actively being restored in Kibale National Park, Uganda. In 1995 degraded land in Kibale was protected from fire and replanted with native seedlings (39 species) at a density of 400 seedlings ha−1. Sixty-five plots (50 m × 10 m) were established in restoration areas in 2005 and 50 of these were re-measured in 2013, allowing changes to be assessed over 18 years. Degraded plots have an Above Ground Biomass (AGB) of 5.1 Mg dry mass ha−1, of which 80\% is grass. By 2005 AGB of trees ⩾10 cm DBH was 9.5 Mg ha−1, increasing to 40.6 Mg ha−1 by 2013, accumulating at a rate of 3.9 Mg ha−1 year−1. A total of 153 planted individuals ha−1 (38\%) remained by 2013, contributing 28.9 Mg ha−1 (70\%) of total AGB. Eighteen years after restoration, AGB in the plots was 12\% of old-growth (419 Mg ha−1). If current accumulation rates continue restoration forest would reach old-growth AGB in a further 96 years. Biodiversity of degraded plots prior to restoration was low with no tree species and 2 seedling species per sample plot (0.05 ha). By 2005 restoration areas had an average of 3 tree and 3 seedling species per sample plot, increasing to 5 tree and 9 seedling species per plot in 2013. However, biodiversity was still significantly lower than old-growth forest, at 8 tree and 16 seedling species in an equivalent area. The results suggest that forest restoration is beneficial for AGB accumulation with planted stems storing the majority of AGB. Changes in biodiversity appear slower; possibly due to low stem turnover. Overall this restoration treatment is an effective means of restoring degraded land in the area, as can be seen from the lack of regeneration in degraded plots, which remain low-AGB and diversity, largely due to the impacts of fire and competition with grasses.},

	abstract = {This study applied a temporal social network analysis model to describe three affiliative social networks (allogrooming, sleep in contact, and triadic interaction) in a non-human primate species, Macaca sylvanus. Three main social mechanisms were examined to determine interactional patterns among group members, namely preferential attachment (i.e., highly connected individuals are more likely to form new connections), triadic closure (new connections occur via previous close connections), and homophily (individuals interact preferably with others with similar attributes). Preferential attachment was only observed for triadic interaction network. Triadic closure was significant in allogrooming and triadic interaction networks. Finally, gender homophily was seasonal for allogrooming and sleep in contact networks, and observed in each period for triadic interaction network. These individual-based behaviors are based on individual reactions, and their analysis can shed light on the formation of the affiliative networks determining ultimate coalition networks, and how these networks may evolve over time. A focus on individual behaviors is necessary for a global interactional approach to understanding social behavior rules and strategies. When combined, these social processes could make animal social networks more resilient, thus enabling them to face drastic environmental changes. This is the first study to pinpoint some of the processes underlying the formation of a social structure in a non-human primate species, and identify common mechanisms with humans. The approach used in this study provides an ideal tool for further research seeking to answer long-standing questions about social network dynamics.},

	abstract = {Researchers have long noted that individuals occupy consistent spatial positions within animal groups. However, an individual's position depends not only on its own behaviour, but also on the behaviour of others. Theoretical models of collective motion suggest that global patterns of spatial assortment can arise from individual variation in local interaction rules. However, this prediction remains untested. Using high-resolution GPS tracking of members of a wild baboon troop, we identify consistent inter-individual differences in within-group spatial positioning. We then apply an algorithm that identifies what number of conspecific group members best predicts the future location of each individual (we call this the individual's neighbourhood size) while the troop is moving. We find clear variation in the most predictive neighbourhood size, and this variation relates to individuals' propensity to be found near the centre of their group. Using simulations, we show that having different neighbourhood sizes is a simple candidate mechanism capable of linking variation in local individual interaction rules—in this case how many conspecifics an individual interacts with—to global patterns of spatial organization, consistent with the patterns we observe in wild primates and a range of other organisms.},

It has been hypothesized that social learning has played a pivotal role in making human societies cooperative, by favouring cooperation even when it is not favoured by genetical selection. However, this hypothesis lacks direct experimental testing, and the opposite prediction has also been made, that social learning disfavours cooperation. We experimentally tested how different aspects of social learning affect the level of cooperation in public-goods games. We found that: (i) social information never increased cooperation and usually led to decreased cooperation; (ii) cooperation was lowest when individuals could observe how successful individuals behaved; and (iii) cooperation declined because individuals preferred to copy successful individuals, who cooperated less, rather than copy common behaviours. Overall, these results suggest that individuals use social information to try and improve their own success, and that this can lead to lower levels of cooperation.},

These differences in the form of social complexity appear to be associated with variation in brain size and probably reflect contrasts in the extent of conflicts of interest between group members. Our results emphasise the limitations of any unitary concept of social complexity and show that variation in average kinship between group members has far-reaching consequences for animal societies.},

	abstract = {Skip to Next Section
This series of four papers investigates the link between the energetics and the mechanics of terrestrial locomotion. Two experimental variables are used throughout the study: speed and body size. Mass-specific metabolic rates of running animals can be varied by about tenfold using either variable. This first paper considers metabolic energy consumed during terrestrial locomotion. New data relating rate of oxygen consumption and speed are reported for: eight species of wild and domestic artiodactyls; seven species of carnivores; four species of primates; and one species of rodent. These are combined with previously published data to formulate a new allometric equation relating mass-specific rates of oxygen consumed (VO2/Mb) during locomotion at a constant speed to speed and body mass (based on data from 62 avian and mammalian species): VO2/Mb = 0.533 Mb-0.316.vg + 0.300 Mb-0.303 where VO2/Mb has the units ml O2 s-1 kg-1; Mb is in kg; and vg is in m s-1. This equation can be expressed in terms of mass-specific rates of energy consumption (Emetab/Mb) using the energetic equivalent of 1 ml O2 = 20.1 J because the contribution of anaerobic glycolysis was negligible: Emetab/Mb = 10.7 Mb-0.316.vg + 6.03 Mb-0.303 where Emetab/Mb has the units watts/kg. This new relationship applies equally well to bipeds and quadrupeds and differs little from the allometric equation reported 12 years ago by Taylor, Schmid-Nielsen \& Raab (1970). Ninety per cent of the values calculated from this genera equation for the diverse assortment of avian and mammalian species included in this regression fall within 25\% of the observed values at the middle of the speed range where measurements were made. This agreement is impressive when one considers that mass-specific rates of oxygen consumption differed by more than 1400\% over this size range of animals.},

For locomotion, the effect of moving each additional unit distance probably depends on the proportional increase in energy expenditure. Other common measures of the cost of locomotion do not reflect the impact of energy expenditure on foraging requirements. In terrestrial mammals, both the effect of body mass and the unit cost itself are very small: moving one kilometre requires less than 2\% of all other energy expenditures combined. Total locomotor energy expenditure ranges from 1/2\% of daily metabolism for a 10 g mammal to 6\% for an elephant. Potential sources of bias in the estimation of these costs include systematic bias in estimates of distance traversed and extra energy required for non-linear locomotion. Because larger mammals can readily locomote at greater speeds, the primary locomotor advantage of large size may not be conservation of energy but of time, which can mean greater safety and more or better food.},

	abstract = {There is currently great interest in developing ecological models for investigating human evolution. Yet little attention has been given to energetics, one of the cornerstones of modern ecosystem ecology. This paper examines the ecological correlates of variation in metabolic requirements among extant primate species, and uses this information to draw inferences about the changes in energy demands over the course of human evolution. Data on body size, resting metabolism, and activity budgets for selected anthropoid species and human hunter-gatherers are used to estimate total energy expenditure (TEE). Analyses indicate that relative energy expenditure levels and day ranges are positively correlated with diet quality; that is, more active species tend to consume more energy-rich diets. Human foragers fall at the positive extremes for modern primates in having high expenditure levels, large ranges, and very high quality diets. During hominid evolution, it appears that TEE increased substantially with the emergence of Homo erectus. This increase is partly attributable to larger body size as well as likely increases in day range and activity level. Assuming similar activity budgets for all early hominid species, estimated TEE for H. erectus is 40–45\% greater than for the australopithecines. If, however, it is assumed that the evolution of early Homo was also associated with a shift to a more “human-like” foraging strategy, estimated expenditure levels for H. erectus are 80–85\% greater than in the australopithecines. Changing patterns of resource distribution associated with the expansion of African savannas between 2.5 and 1.5 mya may been the impetus for a shift in foraging behavior among early members of the genus Homo. Such ecological changes likely would have made animal foods a more attractive resource. Moreover, greater use of animal foods and the resulting higher quality diet would have been important for supporting the larger day ranges and greater energy requirements that appear to have been associated with the evolution of a human-like hunting and gathering strategy.

However, the energetic costs to males of intrasex competition may also be considerable, particularly if males maintain a much larger body size than females. Using data from 19 non‐human primates, this paper examines the relationship between male and female energetic costs both in the short term (daily energy expenditure) and the long term (the energetic cost of producing a single offspring). It is shown that the major determinant of sex differences in energetic costs is body size dimorphism. In the long term, the energetic costs are often greater for females, but, when male body size exceeds female body size by 60\% or more, male energetic costs are greater than those for females. That is, in highly sexually dimorphic species the energetic costs of gestation and lactation for the females are matched by the energetic costs to the males of maintaining a large body size.},

Seven researchers working in teams obtained approximately 1200 hours of animal-observer contact time, representing approximately 2400 hours in the field. The following information is herein presented: (1) data on the estimated energy expenditure of the cebidae population living in the study site; (2) the nutritional composition of some foods eaten by Tikal's howler and spider population; (3) an estimate of the nutritional intake of howlers and spiders; and (4) an estimate of the carrying capacity of the habitat. The above types of data were combined in an attempt to answer the following question: To what extent are population density and size an indication of the carrying capacity of the habitat either in terms of food availability or quality? Data presented in this paper suggest that low population density and small group size are not necessarily the result of a nutritionally poor environment. The Tikal study site is capable of supporting 8,500 animal/km2. In the absence of other comparable quantitative socio-bioenergetic surveys it is herein suggested that the concept of food resource limitation is largely a myth among primatologists.},

	abstract = {1. The recently developed Brownian bridge movement model (BBMM) has advantages over traditional methods because it quantifies the utilization distribution of an animal based on its movement path rather than individual points and accounts for temporal autocorrelation and high data volumes. However, the BBMM assumes unrealistic homogeneous movement behaviour across all data. 2. Accurate quantification of the utilization distribution is important for identifying the way animals use the landscape. 3. We improve the BBMM by allowing for changes in behaviour, using likelihood statistics to determine change points along the animal's movement path. 4. This novel extension, outperforms the current BBMM as indicated by simulations and examples of a territorial mammal and a migratory bird. The unique ability of our model to work with tracks that are not sampled regularly is especially important for GPS tags that have frequent failed fixes or dynamic sampling schedules. Moreover, our model extension provides a useful one-dimensional measure of behavioural change along animal tracks. 5. This new method provides a more accurate utilization distribution that better describes the space use of realistic, behaviourally heterogeneous tracks.},

	abstract = {Strong social relationships confer health and fitness benefits in a number of species, motivating the need to understand the processes through which they arise. In female cercopithecine primates, both kinship and dominance rank are thought to influence rates of affiliative behaviour and social partner preference. Teasing apart the relative importance of these factors has been challenging, however, as female kin often occupy similar positions in the dominance hierarchy. Here, we isolated the specific effects of rank on social relationships in female rhesus macaques by analysing grooming patterns in 18 social groups that did not contain close relatives, and in which dominance ranks were experimentally randomized. We found that grooming was asymmetrically directed towards higher-ranking females and that grooming bouts temporarily decreased the likelihood of aggression between grooming partners, supporting the idea that grooming is associated with social tolerance. Even in the absence of kin, females formed the strongest grooming relationships with females adjacent to them in rank, a pattern that was strongest for the highest-ranking females. Using simulations, we show that three rules for allocating grooming based on dominance rank recapitulated most of the relationships we observed. Finally, we evaluated whether a female's tendency to engage in grooming behaviour was stable across time and social setting. We found that one measure, the rate of grooming females provided to others (but not the rate of grooming females received), exhibited modest stability after accounting for the primary effect of dominance rank. Together, our findings indicate that dominance rank has strong effects on social relationships in the absence of kin, suggesting the importance of considering social status and social connectedness jointly when investigating their health and fitness consequences.},

We then describe underlying themes of the types of errors and postulate contributing factors.

Having examined these errors, we then discuss the consequences of specific errors or classes of errors. Finally, given the extracted themes, we discuss methodological, cultural, and system-level approaches to reducing the frequency of commonly observed errors.

However, the scarcity of studies addressing this issue hinders our understanding of the behavioral adjustments that favor the survival of primates in urban areas. For 12 months, we studied a six-individual group of brown howlers (Alouatta guariba clamitans) in an urban fragment to determine (i) their diet richness and its relationships with food availability, (ii) their daily path length (DPL) and the matrix elements used during movement, and (iii) the main ecological drivers of the DPL. Sampling effort totaled 72 days, 787 hr, and 3,224 instantaneous scans. We found that the diet of brown howlers contained 35 plant species (including seven cultivated crops) belonging to 33 genera and 21 families. The consumption of fruits and young leaves was directly related to their temporal availability. The average DPL (446 m) was smaller than that reported for groups of howlers inhabiting large nonurban fragments. To move between food patches, animals used three main matrix elements: trees, power lines, and roofs. The number of plant species used during the day was the main driver of DPL. Our findings highlighted that the generalist-opportunistic diet of brown howlers and their ability to move across the anthropogenic matrix using artificial elements such as power lines, roofs, and wildlife crossings represent a remarkable part of their behavioral repertory in Lami. However, there are potential costs associated with these strategies, namely, electrocution and predation by domestic dogs. Thus, it is urgent to further investigate how these behaviors could affect the long-term survival of these animals.},

	abstract = {If animals increase inclusive fitness by cooperating with relatives, nepotism should involve maternal and paternal kin equally, all else being equal. Evidence of a behavioral bias toward paternal half-siblings in primates is both limited and mixed, with most positive reports from papionins. To expand knowledge of paternal kin recognition, particularly in cercopithecine monkeys, we examined evidence for paternal kin bias in wild blue monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis), a species living mostly in one-male groups. Seasonal breeding and the amount of male reproductive skew in blue monkeys suggests that opportunities to distinguish paternal kin are plentiful, and their social system would make such discrimination beneficial. We compared spatial association and social contact (grooming and contact-sitting) of 20 adult females with at least one paternal half-sibling and at least one non-relative that were present at the same time. We used two data sets, one in which social partners were other parous females, the other in which they were juveniles. Data came from a 7-year period. When interacting with other adult females, subjects groomed and sat in contact with paternal half-siblings significantly more than with known non-kin, and there was a similar trend for spatial association. We detected no paternal kin bias in interactions with juvenile partners. Kin-biased affiliative contact with adult female partners did not appear to be based on age proximity, measured by birth cohort. The study species’ social system suggests phenotype matching as the most likely alternative mechanism, though we could not test it directly. Across both behaviors, there was no significant relationship between the number of matrilineal kin a subject had and the degree to which she preferred paternal half-siblings over non-kin as affiliative partners. These findings contribute to a comparative understanding of paternal kin recognition in primates.},

	abstract = {Humans in strong social relationships are more likely to live longer because social relationships may buffer stressors and thus have protective effects. However, a shortcoming of human studies is that they often rely on self-reporting of these relationships. By contrast, observational studies of non-human animals permit detailed analyses of the specific nature of social relationships. Thus, discoveries that some social animals live longer and healthier lives if they are involved in social grooming, forage together or have more affiliative associates emphasizes the potential importance of social relationships on health and longevity. Previous studies have focused on the impact of social metrics on longevity in obligately social species. However, if sociality indeed has a key role in longevity, we might expect that affiliative relationships should also influence longevity in less social species. We focused on socially flexible yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer) and asked whether female longevity covaries with the specific nature of social relationships. We quantified social relationships with social network statistics that were based on affiliative interactions, and then estimated the correlation between longevity and sociality using bivariate models. We found a significant negative phenotypic correlation between affiliative social relationship strength and longevity; marmots with greater degree, closeness and those with a greater negative average shortest path length died at younger ages. We conclude that sociality plays an important role in longevity, but how it does so may depend on whether a species is obligately or facultatively social.},

We use resampling techniques and van Tienderen’s (2000) elasticity path analysis to identify rank-related differences in finite rate of increase (λ) and their demographic correlates among segments of a semi-free-ranging rhesus macaque population. Higher-ranking population segments grew at greater rates for some portions of the 40-yr study period. The female members of these segments achieved these lifetime fitness differences through higher fertility and especially higher adult survival rates. This is the first clear evidence that social rank influences female primate adult survival, and is a crucial fitness component for any long-lived, slow-reproducing animal. Traditional methods of comparing lifespans, and other life history variables, among rank categories fail to identify most of the rank-related differences primarily because they require completed life histories that are available only on a small number of the females known in the population.},

	abstract = {Studies of the effects of habitat fragmentation and degradation on primate positional behavior, strata use, and substrate utilization offer valuable insights into the behavioral and ecological flexibility of primates whose habitats have undergone extensive anthropogenic disturbance. In this study, we evaluated how positional behavior, strata use, and substrate utilization differed between Bale monkeys (Chlorocebus djamdjamensis)—bamboo-eating cercopithecids endemic to the southern Ethiopian Highlands—occupying continuous versus fragmented forests. Bale monkeys in forest fragments (where bamboo had been degraded or eradicated) spent significantly more time on the ground and in understory strata whereas those in continuous forest spent significantly more time in the middle and upper strata. Bale monkeys in forest fragments also spent significantly more time walking and galloping and significantly less time climbing than those in continuous forest. Our results suggest that, unlike the primarily arboreal Bale monkeys in continuous forest, Bale monkeys in forest fragments should be characterized as semi-terrestrial. In response to habitat disturbance in fragments, we observed a greater emphasis on terrestrial foraging and travel among Bale monkeys in these human altered habitats, which may put them at greater risk of predation and conflict with nearby human populations. Bale monkeys in fragments exhibit flexibility in their positional behavioral repertoire and their degree of terrestriality is more similar to their sister taxa in Chlorocebus than to Bale monkeys in continuous forest. These findings suggest that habitat alteration may compel Bale monkeys to exhibit semi-terrestrial behaviors crucial for their persistence in human-modified habitats. Our results contribute to a growing body of literature on primate behavioral responses to anthropogenic modification of their habitats and provide information that can contribute to the design of appropriate conservation management plans.},

These behaviors show the social structure of a species and many studies have found positive correlations between the degree of kinship and grooming and proximity. We used 1 year of data collected via instantaneous scan sampling on a large “supertroop” of Colobus angolensis ruwenzorii at Lake Nabugabo, Uganda, to examine partner preferences for grooming and nearest neighbors in each age-sex class. Little is known about this species, so we based our hypotheses on congeners. Of the five species of black-and-white colobus, data on sex-biased dispersal patterns are available for three (C. guereza, C. vellerosus, and C. polykomos), all of which show male-biased dispersal with occasional female dispersal. We thus predicted that female C. a. ruwenzorii would be more strongly bonded than males, showing greater proximity and grooming. We did not expect bonding between the sexes since congeners do not show this pattern. We found that among adult dyads, males and females were more likely to be found in loose proximity, and to groom, than would be expected given group composition. Conversely, both males and females had relatively weak same-sex relationships. Between the sexes, adult males had higher proximity and grooming indices with adult females without infants than with females with infants. These observations indicate that this subspecies is cross-bonded and that both sexes may disperse. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the social organization and social structure of C. a. ruwenzorii differ greatly from other black-and-white colobus species.},

Edge effects can lead to loss of animal and plant species and decreased plant biomass near forest edges. We examined the influence of an anthropogenic forest edge comprising cattle pasture, coconut plantations, and human settlement on the mantled howler (Alouatta palliata), white-faced capuchin (Cebus capucinus), Central American spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), and plant populations at La Suerte Biological Research Station (LSBRS), Costa Rica. We predicted that there would be lower monkey encounter rate, mean tree species richness, and diameter at breast height (DBH) in forest edge versus interior, and that monkeys would show species-specific responses to edge based on diet, body size, and canopy height preferences. Specifically, we predicted that howler monkeys would show positive or neutral edge effects due to their flexible folivorous diet, large body size, and preference for high canopy, capuchins would show positive edge effects due to their diverse diet, small body size, and preference for low to middle canopy, and spider monkeys would show negative edge effects due their reliance on ripe fruit, large body size, and preference for high upper canopy. We conducted population and vegetation surveys along edge and interior transects at LSBRS. Contrary to predictions, total monkey encounter rate did not vary between the forest edge and forest interior. Furthermore, all three species showed neutral edge effects with no significant differences in encounter rate between forest edge and interior. Interior transects had significantly higher mean tree species richness than edge transects, and interior trees had greater DBH than edge trees, although this difference was not significant. These results suggest that forest edges negatively impact plant populations at La Suerte but that the monkeys are able to withstand these differences in vegetation.},

	abstract = {Within-group variation in sociality has been linked to correlates of fitness across vertebrates. Individuals that form strong social bonds with a few partners, or are well integrated into a larger social network, enjoy higher reproductive rates and survival. Less evidence is available on the mediating mechanism(s). Identifying the underlying socioecological mechanisms is crucial for enabling informed predictions about the specific aspect of sociality likely to be selected in a given environment. Here, we first (i) describe measures of within-group sociality, (ii) review existing evidence on the sociality–fitness link in mammals, focusing on studies on wild nonhuman primates, and (iii) discuss potential mechanisms mediating this link. We then (iv) explore these issues in more detail, drawing on our long-term study of wild Assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis) at Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary in Thailand, where we are working toward a comprehensive analysis of the fitness correlates of sociality and the underlying mechanisms that drive affiliative relationships. Using data from several study groups, combined with spatially explicit group-scan data, energy intake data, and genetic analyses of paternity, we show that female–female, female–male, and male–male relationships are similar in kind but may function in different ways. Thus, relationships that form within each sex and between the sexes need to be tackled separately before this knowledge is integrated into a broader general picture. We conclude by providing recommendations for future studies.},

This is especially true for those researchers without a formal background in information theory. Here, we highlight a number of practical obstacles to model averaging complex models. Although not meant to be an exhaustive review, we identify several important issues with tentative solutions where they exist (e.g. dealing with collinearity amongst predictors; how to compute model?averaged parameters) and highlight areas for future research where solutions are not clear (e.g. when to use random intercepts or slopes; which information criteria to use when random factors are involved). We also provide a worked example of a mixed model analysis of inbreeding depression in a wild population. By providing an overview of these issues, we hope that this approach will become more accessible to those investigating any process where multiple variables impact an evolutionary or ecological response.},

Comm. 7, 12084 (doi:10.1038/ncomms12084)) has demonstrated that network structure can be maintained by a simple process of social inheritance. Here, we ask how juvenile vervet monkeys integrate into their adult grooming networks, using the model to test whether observed grooming patterns replicate network structure. Female juveniles, who are philopatric, increased their grooming effort towards adults more than males, although this was not reciprocated by the adults themselves. While more consistent maternal grooming networks, together with maternal network strength, predicted increasing similarity in the patterning of mother–daughter grooming allocations, daughters' grooming networks generally did not match closely those of their mothers. However, maternal networks themselves were not very consistent across time, thus presenting youngsters with a moving target that may be difficult to match. Observed patterns of juvenile female grooming did not replicate the adult network, for which increased association with adults not groomed by their mothers would be necessary. These results suggest that network flexibility, not stability, characterizes our groups and that juveniles are exposed to, and must learn to cope with, temporal shifts in network structure. We hypothesize that this may lead to individual variation in behavioural flexibility, which in turn may help explain why and how variation in sociability influences fitness.},

In primates, strong social bonds have been associated with increased longevity, offspring survival and reproductive success. However, little is known about the fitness effects of social bonds between non-kin, especially outside of mammals. In this study, we use long-term field research on a cooperatively breeding bird, the greater ani (Crotophaga major), to ask whether adult females benefit by remaining in long-term associations with unrelated, co-breeding females. We find that females that have previously nested together synchronize their reproduction more rapidly than those nesting with unfamiliar partners, which leads to lower competition and higher fledging success. Importantly, although previous experience with a co-breeding female influenced reproductive synchrony, the degree of reproductive synchrony did not influence whether co-breeding females remained together in subsequent years, ruling out the alternate hypothesis that highly synchronized females are simply more likely to remain together. These results indicate that switching groups is costly to females, and that social familiarity improves reproductive coordination. Stable social relationships therefore have significant fitness consequences for cooperatively nesting female birds, suggesting that direct benefits alone may favour the evolution of associations between non-relatives and contribute to long-term group stability.},

On the other hand, 3 individual-based models have shown that reciprocation may emerge via “symmetry-based reciprocity,” “emotional bookkeeping,” or a combination of both mechanisms. Here, we use these 3 models to assess their relative fit with empirical data on reciprocation and social network structure across different groups and species of macaques. We collected grooming data from 14 groups and 8 macaque species and simulated each group in each model. We analyzed and quantitatively compared social network metrics of the empirical and the models’ grooming networks. The 3 models captured fairly well the features of observed networks, and fitted data from wild groups better than captive ones. The emotional bookkeeping model seemed on average to fit slightly better the social networks metrics observed in empirical data, but failed to reproduce some grooming patterns. The symmetry-based models, on the other hand, fitted better other network parameters (e.g., modularity). No model generally fitted the data better than the others, and the fit with some metrics (e.g., modularity, centralization index) was low even after optimization. Thus, our analyses indicate that in the models social interactions may be simpler than in reality and models may miss social processes (e.g., third-party awareness).},

	abstract = {We developed a potential distribution model for the tropical rain forest species of primates of southern Mexico: the black howler monkey (Alouatta pigra), the mantled howler monkey (Alouatta palliata), and the spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi). To do so, we applied the maximum entropy algorithm from the ecological niche modeling program MaxEnt. For each species, we used occurrence records from scientific collections, and published and unpublished sources, and we also used the 19 environmental coverage variables related to precipitation and temperature from WorldClim to develop the models. The predicted distribution of A. pigra was strongly associated with the mean temperature of the warmest quarter (23.6\%), whereas the potential distributions of A. palliata and A. geoffroyi were strongly associated with precipitation during the coldest quarter (52.2 and 34.3\% respectively). The potential distribution of A. geoffroyi is broader than that of the Alouatta spp. The areas with the greatest probability of presence of A. pigra and A. palliata are strongly associated with riparian vegetation, whereas the presence of A. geoffroyi is more strongly associated with the presence of rain forest. Our most significant contribution is the identification of areas with a high probability of the presence of these primate species, which is information that can be applied to planning future studies and then establishing criteria for the creation of areas to primate conservation in Mexico.},

	abstract = {The Beza Mahafaly Project in southwestern Madagascar was founded in 1975. It was established as a collaborative effort among the University of Madagascar (now University of Antananarivo), Washington University, Yale University, and the local communities for long-term training and research, biodiversity conservation, and socioeconomic development. Beza Mahafaly consists of two noncontiguous forest parcels separated by 10 km that became a protected area (Réserve Spéciale) in 1986: an 80-ha gallery forest and a 520-ha xerophytic spiny forest. The region has a diversity of habitats and a very diverse and highly endemic flora and fauna, including four species of lemurs found in or near the reserve. The ringtailed lemur (Lemur catta) and Verreaux’s sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) have been the subject of our long-term research. In this chapter we highlight some of the results of this research. Our multidisciplinary studies illustrate the feasibility of collecting long-term data on careers of individual animals and of obtaining large samples on numerous animals, across numerous social groups, in relatively isolated breeding populations. Thus, we can provide insights into many of the demographic, socioecological, anthropogenic, and epidemiological factors that shape the local ringtailed lemur and sifaka population. Here we summarize how ringtailed lemur demographic structure is affected by climatic perturbations (drought); how aspects of general health (parasite loads and dental health) are directly related to habitat, dietary, and anthropogenic factors; how tight birth seasonality in sifaka can elicit stress responses in males associated with increased male aggression, group takeovers, and infanticide risk; how life history schedules are related to evolutionary responses to extreme climatic fluctuations; and how directional selection among sifaka males leads to longer, stronger legs, but not to increase in male body mass relative to females.},

	abstract = {The introduction and eradication of alien invasive plant species potentially alters feeding and spatial ecology of wild primates. We investigated whether the removal of an important dietary resource for wild chacma baboons (Papio hamadryas ursinus), black wattle (Acacia mearnsii), from a nature reserve would result in longer daily path lengths (DPLs) and greater movement toward other resources, specifically alternative black wattle stands outside the reserve, agricultural plots, and sleeping and geophagy sites. We fitted a juvenile male baboon with a self-releasing GPS collar to track the focal troop’s movements on Wildcliff Nature Reserve and adjacent properties, located in the Western Cape, South Africa, from January 25, 2010 to January 18, 2011. During this time, Working for Water, an environmental conservation initiative of the South African Department of Water Affairs, removed black wattle from the baboons’ home range. We estimated monthly home range (5.30–20.58 km2) and DPL (1.7–11.7 km) and quantified the baboons’ use of five dominant vegetation types. Our vegetation use-availability analysis indicated that the troop preferred black wattle, Afromontane forests, and, to a lesser extent, pasture, but used agricultural plots and fynbos less than expected by availability. With increasing black wattle removal in the core area, the troop traveled further toward distant sources of black wattle, using sleeping sites out of their core area to accommodate such long day journeys. A general linear model indicated that movement to black wattle stands, as well as changing sleeping sites, day length, and both spring and winter seasons all significantly increased DPL. We suggest the influence that alien invasive species and their eradication has on ranging behavior should be a consideration in primate conservation and management policies.},

	abstract = {Ecological studies of orangutans have almost exclusively focused on populations living in primary or selectively logged rainforest. The response of orangutans to severe habitat degradation remains therefore poorly understood. Most experts assume that viable populations cannot survive outside undisturbed or slightly disturbed forests. This is a concern because nearly 75\% of all orangutans live outside protected areas, where degradation of natural forests is likely to occur, or where these are replaced by planted forests. To improve our understanding of orangutan survival in highly altered forest habitats, we conducted population density surveys in two pulp and paper plantation concessions in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. These plantations consist of areas planted with fast-growing exotics intermixed with stands of highly degraded forests and scrublands. Our rapid surveys indicate unexpectedly high orangutan densities in plantation landscapes dominated by Acacia spp., although it remains unclear whether such landscapes can maintain long-term viable populations. These findings indicate the need to better understand how plantation-dominated landscapes can potentially be incorporated into orangutan conservation planning. Although we emphasize that plantations have less value for overall biodiversity conservation than natural forests, they could potentially boost the chances of orangutan survival. Our findings are based on a relatively short study and various methodological issues need to be addressed, but they suggest that orangutans may be more ecologically flexible than previously thought.},

	doi = {DOI: 10.1093/beheco/2.2.143},
	abstract = {The fact that most female primates (and many other mammals) live in groups is paradoxical, given that the presence of others presumably increases competition for foods and may, for some, reduce reproductive success. Competition for food resources is generally inferred from any of the following observations: (1) female dominance hierarchies within groups; (2) female aggression between groups; (3) increasing home-range size with increasing group size; (4) longer day-range length with increasing group size; and (5) lower reproductive rates in larger groups. Both female aggression (interference competition) and adjustments of ranging behavior to group size (exploitative competition) have been linked in the past to patterns of food distribution and abundance. Using data largely from the literature, this paper examines the covariance of female aggression and ranging behavior among 20 species of primates in an attempt to better explain the variation in female relationships within and between groups of primates. Results show that groups of females are aggressive toward other groups and that home-range size increases with increasing group size in most species. In addition, in those species with strong dominance hierarchies within groups, day-range length increases as a function of group size. However, in those species that do not have strong dominance hierarchies within groups, dayrange length does not increase as a function of group size. The implications of these results are presented in a model that suggests that intergroup competition is determined by food abundance, whereas intragroup competition is determined by food distribution. This model differs from earlier models in its explanation of the ecological conditions that influence female relationships within and between groups of primates. [Behav Ecol 1991;2:143–155]},

	abstract = {Kibale National Park, within the Albertine Rift, is known for its rich biodiversity. High human population density and agricultural conversion in the surrounding landscape have created enormous resource pressure on forest fragments outside the park. Kibale presents a complex protected forest landscape comprising intact forest inside the park, logged areas inside the park, a game corridor with degraded forest, and forest fragments in the landscape surrounding the park. To explore the effect of these different levels of forest management and protection over time, we assessed forest change over the previous three decades, using both discrete and continuous data analyses of satellite imagery. Park boundaries have remained fairly intact and forest cover has been maintained or increased inside the park, while there has been a high level of deforestation in the landscape surrounding the park. While absolute changes in land cover are important changes in vegetation productivity, within land cover classes are often more telling of longer term changes and future directions of change. The park has lower Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values than the forest fragments outside the park and the formerly logged area—probably due to forest regeneration and early succession stage. The corridor region has lower productivity, which is surprising given this is also a newer regrowth region and so should be similar to the logged and forest fragments. Overall, concern can be raised for the future trajectory of this park. Although forest cover has been maintained, forest health may be an issue, which for future management, climate change, biodiversity, and increased human pressure may signify troubling signs.},

	abstract = {We review studies that consider how food affects primate population abundance. In order to explain spatial variation in primate abundance, various correlates that parameterize quality and quantity of food in the habitat have been examined. We propose two hypotheses concerning how resource availability and its seasonality determine animal abundance. When the quality of fallback foods (foods eaten during the scarcity of preferred foods) is too low to satisfy nutritional requirement, total annual food quantity should determine population size, but this relationship can be modified by the quality or the quantity of fallback foods. This mechanism has been established for Japanese macaques and sportive lemurs that survive lean seasons by fat storage or extremely low metabolism. Second, when fallback food quality is high enough to satisfy nutritional requirement but quantity is limited, quantity of fallback food should be a limiting factor of animal abundance. This is supported by the correlation between fig density, which is a high-quality fallback food, and gibbon and orangutan abundance. For a direct test of these hypotheses, we need more research that determines both the quality of food that animals require to satisfy their nutritional requirement and the quantity of food production. Leaves are often regarded as superabundant, but this assumption needs careful examination.},

However, in the tropics there are two important factors that may interact to threaten this objective: 1) road development associated with large-scale resource extraction near or within protected areas; and 2) historical occupancy by traditional or indigenous groups that depend on wildlife for their survival. To manage wildlife populations in the tropics, it is critical to understand the effects of roads on the spatial extent of hunting and how wildlife is used. A geographical analysis can help us answer questions such as: How do roads affect spatial extent of hunting? How does market vicinity relate to local consumption and trade of bushmeat? How does vicinity to markets influence choice of game? A geographical analysis also can help evaluate the consequences of increased accessibility in landscapes that function as source-sink systems. We applied spatial analyses to evaluate the effects of increased landscape and market accessibility by road development on spatial extent of harvested areas and wildlife use by indigenous hunters. Our study was conducted in Yasuní Biosphere Reserve, Ecuador, which is impacted by road development for oil extraction, and inhabited by the Waorani indigenous group. Hunting activities were self-reported for 12–14 months and each kill was georeferenced. Presence of roads was associated with a two-fold increase of the extraction area. Rates of bushmeat extraction and trade were higher closer to markets than further away. Hunters located closer to markets concentrated their effort on large-bodied species. Our results clearly demonstrate that placing roads within protected areas can seriously reduce their capacity to sustain wildlife populations and potentially threaten livelihoods of indigenous groups who depend on these resources for their survival. Our results critically inform current policy debates regarding resource extraction and road building near or within protected areas.},

Females, as well as males, immigrated into study groups and transferred between groups, something that has been rarely seen in this subspecies. We also found a significant decline in the amount of fruit from the earliest part of the study to the latter part of the study. Study groups did not switch to other types of foods during periods of fruit shortage, but traveled outside of their home range areas more often over the study period. Finally, the density E. f. rufus decreased in the study area while the densities of their main food competitors, Varecia variegata and Eulemur rubriventer, increased. Although few primate populations are numerically stable over time, we suggest that female behavioral responses to decreases in fruit availability may have influenced some of the demographic changes we witnessed in this study.

	abstract = {Understanding the causes of population declines often involves comprehending a complex set of interactions linking environmental and biotic changes, which in combination overwhelm a population's ability to persist. To understand these relationships, especially for long-lived large mammals, long-term data are required, but rarely available. Here we use 26–36 years of population and habitat data to determine the potential causes of group density changes for five species of primates in Kibale National Park, Uganda, in areas that were disturbed to varying intensities in the late 1960s. We calculated group density from line transect data and quantified changes in habitat structure (cumulative diameter at breast height [dbh] and food availability [cumulative dbh of food trees]) for each primate species, and for one species, we evaluated change in food nutritional quality. We found that mangabeys and black-and-white colobus group density increased, blue monkeys declined, and redtails and red colobus were stable in all areas. For blue monkeys and mangabeys, there were no significant changes in food availability over time, yet their group density changed. For redtails, neither group density measures nor food availability changed over time. For black-and-white colobus, a decrease in food availability over time in the unlogged forest surprisingly coincided with an increase in group density. Finally, while red colobus food availability and quality increased over time in the heavily logged area, their group density was stable in all areas. We suggest that these populations are in nonequilibrium states. If such states occur frequently, it suggests that large protected areas will be required to protect species so that declines in some areas can be compensated for by increases in adjacent areas with different histories.},

Surveys conducted over 28 years were used to quantify the long-term effects of both low- and high-intensity selective logging on the density of the five common primates in Kibale National Park, Uganda. The most dramatic exception to the expectation that primate populations will recover following logging was that group densities of Cercopithecus mitis and C. ascanius in the heavily logged area continued to decline decades after logging. Procolobus tephrosceles populations were recovering in the heavily logged areas, but the rate of increase appeared to be slow (0.005 groups/km2 per year). Colobus guereza appeared to do well in some disturbed habitats and were found at higher group densities in the logged areas than in the unlogged area. There was no evidence of an increase in Lophocebus albigena group density in the heavily logged area since the time of logging, and there was a tendency for its population to be lower in heavily logged areas than in lightly logged areas. In contrast to the findings from the heavily logged area, none of the species were found at a lower group density in the lightly logged area than in the unlogged area, and group densities in this area were not changing at a statistically significant rate. The results of our study suggest that, in this region, low-intensity selective logging could be one component of conservation plans for primates; high-intensity logging, however, which is typical of most logging operations throughout Africa, is incompatible with primate conservation.},

	abstract = {Abstract Since the first field primate studies there has been debate over whether or not provisioning as an aid to observation of free?ranging groups alters behavior and population processes to the extent that those studies are not indicative of the animals' natural lives. If they are not, a significant amount of long?term data on several species of primates would be rendered irrelevant to analysis of natural population processes, and to the pool of knowledge of behavior and social groups on which a picture of historical and current selection pressures is built. At present these studies cannot be used comparatively with nonprovisioned studies due to lack of information on quantities of food supplement or certainty about effects of different provisioning methods on demography and behavior. The perception that Japanese primate studies are conducted largely on provisioned groups is inaccurate. An expanding number of study populations within Japan and most overseas studies are conducted without provisioning. Historically, the reason for provisioning the endemic Japanese macaque was to facilitate observation, but it has since become also a means of conservation. Provisioning in most other instances by both Japanese and Western primatologists has been done on an ad hoc basis. Studies of supplemental feeding effects on non?primate species suggest that food supply secondarily limits population density and fecundity is not the most important factor affecting population increase. Provisioning is essential to the survival of many primate groups and provisioned groups will likely increase. Studies of natural primate ecology should be used to determine the least intrusive methods of supplementary feeding.},

We offer a necessary first step: revision of geographic ranges and quantification of habitat area and population size for diurnal and cathemeral (active during both day and night) lemurs. Recent satellite images are used to develop a forest cover geographical information system, and censuses are used to establish range boundaries and develop estimates of population density and size. These assessments are used to identify regions and taxa at risk, and will be a useful baseline for future monitoring of habitat and populations. Precise estimates are impossible for patchily-distributed taxa (especially Hapalemur aureus, H. simus and Varecia variegata variegata); these taxa require more sophisticated modelling.},

For example, in adult female baboons and juvenile horses, individuals with stronger or more social ties experience greater survival. We used detailed behavioral and life history records to explore the relationship between tie quality and survival in a gregarious monkey (Cercopithecus mitis stuhlmanni), while controlling for dominance rank, group size, and life history strategy. We used Cox proportional hazards regressions to model the cumulative (multi?year) and current (single?year) relationships of social ties and the hazard of mortality in 83 wild adult females of known age, observed 2?8 years each (437 subject?years) in eight social groups. The strength of bonds with close partners was associated with increased mortality risk under certain conditions: Females that had strong bonds with close partners that were inconsistent over multiple years had a higher risk of mortality than females adopting any other social strategy. Within a given year, females had a higher risk of death if they were strongly bonded with partners that changed from the previous year versus with partners that remained consistent. Dominance rank, number of adult female groupmates, and age at first reproduction did not predict the risk of death. This study demonstrates that costs and benefits of strong social bonds can be context?dependent, relating to the consistency of social partners over time.},

	abstract = {Although cooperatively breeding vertebrates occur disproportionately in unpredictable environments, the underlying mechanism shaping this biogeographic pattern remains unclear. Cooperative breeding may buffer against harsh conditions (hard life hypothesis), or additionally allow for sustained breeding under benign conditions (temporal variability hypothesis). To distinguish between the hard life and temporal variability hypotheses, we investigated whether the number of alloparents at a nest increased reproductive success or load-lightening in superb starlings (Lamprotornis superbus), and whether these two types of benefits varied in harsh and benign years. We found that mothers experienced both types of benefits consistent with the temporal variability hypothesis, as larger contingents of alloparents increased the number of young fledged while simultaneously allowing mothers to reduce their provisioning rates under both harsh and benign rainfall conditions. By contrast, fathers experienced load-lightening only under benign rainfall conditions, suggesting that cooperative breeding may serve to take advantage of unpredictable benign breeding seasons when they do occur. Cooperative breeding in unpredictable environments may thus promote flexibility in offspring care behaviour, which could mitigate variability in the cost of raising young. Our results highlight the importance of considering how offspring care decisions vary among breeding roles and across fluctuating environmental conditions.},

Previous field studies of cooperation in human communities have revealed variability in the extent to which each of these theories explains human sociality in different contexts. We conducted multivariate social network analyses predicting costly cooperation—labouring on another household's farm—in 128 082 dyads of Mosuo farming households in southwest China. Through information-theoretic model selection, we tested the roles played by genealogical relatedness, affinal relationships (including reproductive partners), reciprocity, relative need, wealth, household size, spatial proximity and gift-giving in an economic game. The best-fitting model included all factors, along with interactions between relatedness and (i) reciprocity, (ii) need, (iii) the presence of own children in another household and (iv) proximity. Our results show how a real-world form of cooperation was driven by kinship. Households tended to help kin in need (but not needy non-kin) and travel further to help spatially distant relatives. Households were more likely to establish reciprocal relationships with distant relatives and non-kin but closer kin cooperated regardless of reciprocity. These patterns of kin-driven cooperation show the importance of inclusive fitness in understanding human social behaviour.},

	abstract = {The social relationships that individuals experience at different life stages have a non-negligible influence on their lives, and this is particularly true for group living animals. The long lifespan of many primates makes it likely that these animals have various tactics of social interaction to adapt to complex changes in environmental or physical conditions. The different strategies used in social interaction by individuals at different life stages, and whether the position (central or peripheral) or role (initiator or recipient) of an individual in the group social network changes with age, are intriguing questions that remain to be investigated. We used social network analysis to examine age-related differences in social interaction patterns, social roles, and social positions in three affiliative social networks (approach, allogrooming, and social play) in a group of wild rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Our results showed that social interaction patterns of rhesus macaques differ between age classes in the following ways: i) young individuals tend to allocate social time to a high number of groupmates, older individuals prefer to focus on fewer, specific partners; ii) as they grow older, individuals tend to be recipients in approach interactions and initiators in grooming interactions; and iii) regardless of the different social interaction strategies, individuals of all ages occupy a central position in the group. These results reveal a possible key role played by immature individuals in group social communication, a little-explored issue which deserves closer investigation in future research.},

	abstract = {* The traits of the primary case of an infectious disease outbreak, and the circumstances for their aetiology, potentially influence the trajectory of transmission dynamics. However, these dynamics likely also depend on the traits of the individuals with whom the primary case interacts.


* We used the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola to test how the traits of the primary case, group phenotypic composition and group size interact to facilitate the transmission of a GFP-labelled cuticular bacterium. We also compared bacterial transmission across experimentally generated “daisy-chain” vs. “star” networks of social interactions. Finally, we compared social network structure across groups of different sizes.


* Groups of 10 spiders experienced more bacterial transmission events compared to groups of 30 spiders, regardless of groups’ behavioural composition. Groups containing only one bold spider experienced the lowest levels of bacterial transmission regardless of group size. We found no evidence for the traits of the primary case influencing any transmission dynamics. In a second experiment, bacteria were transmitted to more individuals in experimentally induced star networks than in daisy-chains, on which transmission never exceeded three steps. In both experimental network types, transmission success depended jointly on the behavioural traits of the interacting individuals; however, the behavioural traits of the primary case were only important for transmission on star networks.


* Larger social groups exhibited lower interaction density (i.e. had a low ratio of observed to possible connections) and were more modular, i.e. they had more connections between nodes within a subgroup and fewer connections across subgroups. Thus, larger groups may restrict transmission by forming fewer interactions and by isolating subgroups that interacted with the primary case.


* These findings suggest that accounting for the traits of single exposed hosts has less power in predicting transmission dynamics compared to the larger scale factors of the social groups in which they reside. Factors like group size and phenotypic composition appear to alter social interaction patterns, which leads to differential transmission of microbes.},

The evolution of allonursing may also be influenced by variation in the possible costs to allonurses. The relative influence of costs and benefits on the incidence of allonursing in mammals remains unexplored. We show, using comparative analyses, that where females group with kin, the presence or the absence of allonursing is not associated with further variation in relatedness. Allonursing is most common where females produce litters; here the relative investment per offspring is low, and the costs of nursing additional young are likely to be reduced. Our results suggest that variation in the potential benefits is not associated with the distribution of allonursing, but that allonursing can quickly evolve when the costs to allonurses of nursing additional offspring are low.},

	abstract = {Humans’ propensity to cooperate is driven by our embeddedness in social networks. A key mechanism through which networks promote cooperation is clustering. Within clusters, conditional cooperators are insulated from exploitation by noncooperators, allowing them to reap the benefits of cooperation. Dynamic networks, where ties can be shed and new ties formed, allow for the endogenous emergence of clusters of cooperators. Although past work suggests that either reputation processes or network dynamics can increase clustering and cooperation, existing work on network dynamics conflates reputations and dynamics. Here we report results from a large-scale experiment (total n = 2,675) that embedded participants in clustered or random networks that were static or dynamic, with varying levels of reputational information. Results show that initial network clustering predicts cooperation in static networks, but not in dynamic ones. Further, our experiment shows that while reputations are important for partner choice, cooperation levels are driven purely by dynamics. Supplemental conditions confirmed this lack of a reputation effect. Importantly, we find that when participants make individual choices to cooperate or defect with each partner, as opposed to a single decision that applies to all partners (as is standard in the literature on cooperation in networks), cooperation rates in static networks are as high as cooperation rates in dynamic networks. This finding highlights the importance of structured relations for sustained cooperation, and shows how giving experimental participants more realistic choices has important consequences for whether dynamic networks promote higher levels of cooperation than static networks.},

	abstract = {Individuals can differ in how much they benefit from being in a group depending on characteristics such as their dominance rank or their behavior. Understanding which categories of individuals influence the decisions of a group could help understand which individuals are benefiting the most. We examine these ideas in wild flocks of black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus), which feature stable group membership and linear dominance hierarchies. We attempt to infer which individuals are influencing group movement by examining how individuals initiate and join foraging events in relation to their dominance rank, exploratory personality type and position within a social network. We find that the influence of dominance on these behaviors heavily depends on the social connections an individual has, and that the effect of exploratory personality was small. Dominant individuals with a high eigenvector centrality were more likely to initiate a foraging event, whereas among individuals with a low eigenvector centrality this relationship was reversed, with subordinates being slightly more likely to initiate a foraging event. Analysis also suggested that individuals with a large number of strong social connections would be less affected by dominance than less social individuals. This suggests a system where individuals might adopt different foraging strategies depending on their position within a social network, and highlights the importance of individuals’ social phenotype when studying group decision-making.},

This may be due to a number of factors such as female peer-group transfer, the small number of groups available to a transferee, the lack of sexual dimorphism, and the presence and importance of females in initiating and defending the social integrity of the social unit. It is clear from this that the presence of female-transfer, male-residence patterns is not always enough to automatically predict strong male-male bonds. Other factors must also be considered.},

	abstract = {Frequent hunting of red colobus monkeys (Procolobus rufomitratus) takes place at all long-term chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) study sites where both species are present. Red colobus are the most commonly selected prey of chimpanzees even when other monkey species are more abundant. In particular, the chimpanzee community at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda, preys heavily on red colobus monkeys: the chimpanzee hunting success rate is extremely high, and chimpanzees kill many individuals per successful hunt. Census data had suggested that the red colobus population is declining and that predation by chimpanzees may be contributing to this decline. In this paper, I address the impact of hunting on the red colobus population at Ngogo. To test the hypothesis that chimpanzee hunting is sustainable, I am using demographic data collected on red colobus monkeys over a period of 3 years, as well as fecundity and mortality data from previous studies of this species. I apply matrix models and vortex analyses using a sensitivity analysis approach to project future population development. Results show that current rates of hunting are not sustainable, but that chimpanzees are neither more ‘‘noble’’, nor more ‘‘savage’’ than humans are, but that they also hunt to ensure maximum beneﬁt without regard for the consequences for the prey population.},

	abstract = {In this 3-year investigation we documented patterns of density, diet, and activity of red colobus monkeys (Procolobus tephrosceles) in six areas in or near Kibale National Park, Uganda and related these patterns to availability of food resources. There were large differences in the density and behavior of the red colobus among the sites. For example, the red colobus at one site with a diverse plant community of more than 61 tree species, had a diet that included at least 42 species. In contrast, at a second site red colobus spent 92\% of their feeding time eating from one species that dominated the tree community. The density of important red colobus food trees varied among sites from 32 trees/ha to 204 trees/ha, and red colobus density ranged from 0.70 groups/km2 to 7.41 groups/km2. Among sites, red colobus density was related to the cumulative DBH of important food trees, when one apparently anomalous site was excluded, and populations with more plant species in their diets tended to be those that were found at higher densities. Activity budgets of the red colobus populations varied markedly among sites. For example, feeding time ranged among sites from 29 to 55\%, and traveling varied from 5 to 20\%. When faced with increased foraging demands, red colobus reduced the time spent resting, while the time spent socializing remained fairly constant. Comparative socioecological studies typically contrast species separated by large geographical distances to ensure there is sufficient variation in the environment to detect behavioral responses. The marked differences in ecological conditions and red colobus behavior we documented over short geographical distances, suggests that small-scale contrasts are a useful tool to examine ecological determinants of behavior and community structure.},

	abstract = {The red colobus and redtail monkeys are the two most common primates in the Kibale Forest, yet they show pronounced differences in most aspects of their behaviour and ecology. The red colobus live in large multi-male social groups with home ranges that completely overlap with those of other conspecific social groups. The redtails live in medium-sized, one-male social groups and actively defend territories against other conspecific social groups. Red colobus feed primarily on young plant growth, especially buds, flowers, and young leaves. In contrast, redtails feed heavily on fruits and arthropods. Comparisons are made of inter-individual spacing, adult male interactions, mating systems, grooming, social relations of neonates, inter-group relations and diet, time budgets, vertical stratification, ranging, biomass, density and yield. It is suggested that differences in the density, dispersion patterns and renewal rates of the divergent classes of food account for much of the contrast in life styles of these two monkey species. Résumé Le colobe bai et la cercopithèque ascagne sont les deux primates les plus communs de la forêt de Kibale, bien qu'ils présentent des différences prononcées dans la plupart des aspects de leur comportement et de leur écologie. Le colobe bai vit en grands groupes sociaux à plusieurs mâles dont les domaines vitaux recouvrent complètement ceux d'autres groupes conspécifiques. Les cercopithèques ascagnes vivent en groupes sociaux moyens à mâle unique et défendent activement leur territoire contre les autres groupes sociaux conspécifiques. Les colobes bais se nourrissent principalement de jeunes pousses, spécialement des bourgeons, des fleurs et de jeunes feuilles. Les cercopithèques, eux, mangent essentiellement des fruits et des arthropodes. On compare les distances entre individus, les interactions des mâles adultes, les processus d'accouplement, de toilette, les relations sociales des nouveaux-nés, les relations entre les groupes ainsi que les régimes alimentaires, les actogrammes, la stratification verticale, la dispersion, la densité et la production de biomasse. On suggère que les différences de fréquence, de mode de distribution et de taux de renouvellement des diverses sources de nourriture entrent en ligne de compte pour une bonne part du contraste dans les modes de vie de ces deux espèces.},

We quantify and contextualize the current state of knowledge about the effects of contemporary climate change on non-human primates, a taxon of great ecological and anthropological significance. Specifically, we report findings from a systematic literature search designed to assess the allocation of research effort on primates and climate change and consider how the current distribution of knowledge may be influencing our understanding of the topic. We reveal significant phylogenetic and geographic gaps in our knowledge, which is strongly biased towards lemurs, apes, and a relatively small subset of primate range countries. We show that few analyses investigate changes in primate foods relative to changes in primates themselves or their habitats, and observe that few longitudinal datasets are of sufficient duration to detect effects on the generational scale. We end by identifying areas of research inquiry that would advance our theoretical understanding of primate ecology, evolution, and adaptability, and meaningfully contribute to primate conservation.},

	abstract = {Experimental laboratory evidence suggests that animals with disrupted social systems express weakened relationship strengths and have more exclusive social associations, and that these changes have functional consequences. A key question is whether anthropogenic pressures have a similar impact on the social structure of wild animal communities. We addressed this question by constructing a social network from 6 years of systematically collected photographic capture–recapture data spanning 1,139 individual adult female Masai giraffes inhabiting a large, unfenced, heterogeneous landscape in northern Tanzania. We then used the social network to identify distinct social communities, and tested whether social or anthropogenic and other environmental factors predicted differences in social structure among these communities. We reveal that giraffes have a multilevel social structure. Local preferences in associations among individuals scale up to a number of distinct, but spatially overlapping, social communities, that can be viewed as a large interconnected metapopulation. We then find that communities that are closer to traditional compounds of Indigenous Masai people express weaker relationship strengths and the giraffes in these communities are more exclusive in their associations. The patterns we characterize in response to proximity to humans reflect the predictions of disrupted social systems. Near bomas, fuelwood cutting can reduce food resources, and groups of giraffes are more likely to encounter livestock and humans on foot, thus disrupting the social associations among group members. Our results suggest that human presence could potentially be playing an important role in determining the conservation future of this megaherbivore.},

	abstract = {Male-male social relationships in group-living mammals vary from fierce competition to the formation of opportunistic coalitions or the development of long-lasting bonds. We investigated male-male relationships in Guinea baboons (Papio papio), a species characterized by male-male tolerance and affiliation. Guinea baboons live in a multi-level society, with units of one reproductively active “primary” male, 1–6 females, and offspring at the core level. Together with “bachelor” males, several units form a party, and 2–3 parties constitute a gang. We aimed to clarify to which degree male relationship patterns varied with relatedness and pair-bond status, i.e., whether males had primary or bachelor status. Data were collected from 24 males in two parties of Guinea baboons near Simenti in the Niokolo-Koba National Park in Senegal. Males maintained differentiated and equitable affiliative relationships (“strong bonds”) with other males that were stable over a 4-year period, irrespective of their pair-bond status. Remarkably, most bachelor males maintained strong bonds with multiple primary males, indicating that bachelor males play an important role in the cohesion of the parties. A clear male dominance hierarchy could not be established due to the high degree of uncertainty in individual rank scores, yet bachelor males were more likely to be found at the low end of the dominance hierarchy. Average relatedness was significantly higher between strongly bonded males, suggesting that kin biases contribute to the social preferences of males. Long-term data will be needed to test how male bonds affect male tenure and ultimately reproductive success.},

We assess how tree species richness and composition recover during secondary succession across gradients in environmental conditions and anthropogenic disturbance in an unprecedented multisite analysis for the Neotropics. Secondary forests recover remarkably fast in species richness but slowly in species composition. Secondary forests take a median time of five decades to recover the species richness of old-growth forest (80\% recovery after 20 years) based on rarefaction analysis. Full recovery of species composition takes centuries (only 34\% recovery after 20 years). A dual strategy that maintains both old-growth forests and species-rich secondary forests is therefore crucial for biodiversity conservation in human-modified tropical landscapes.
Tropical secondary forests recover quickly (decades) in tree species richness but slowly (centuries) in species composition.

	abstract = {Several recent studies show that animal friendships, like human friendships, are durable and have fitness benefits by increasing survival, infant survival, or reproductive success. However, the determinants of especially non-kin friendships are unclear. Human non-kin friendships are partly determined by similarity in personality. We investigated personality similarity of friends in 38 captive chimpanzees. Within-subject comparisons revealed that friends are more similar than non-friends in their Sociability and Boldness. Subsequent analyses, including both kin- and non-kin dyads, revealed higher similarity in Sociability among all individuals who sat in contact more often, while in Boldness and Grooming Equity the positive effect of similarity was only found in non-kin individuals’ contact-sitting. Our results show that similar to humans, chimpanzees’ friendships are related to homophily in certain personality characteristics, particularly those relevant for socio-positive and cooperative behaviour. We suggest that having friends similar to self in personality decreases uncertainty in interactions by promoting reliability especially in cooperative contexts, and is consequently adaptive. Further, we suggest that homophily in human friendships dates back at least to our last common ancestor with chimpanzees.},

Among primates, maternal kinship frequently coincides with a higher frequency of grooming and agonistic aiding, but the extent to which paternal kinship influences adult female social relationships has not yet been investigated. Here, we examine the effect of both maternal and paternal kinship, as well as age proximity, on affiliative interactions among semifree-ranging adult female rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta. Kinship was assessed by using both microsatellites and DNA-fingerprinting. Our study confirms that the closest affiliative relationships characterize maternal half-sisters. We provide evidence that adult females are significantly more affiliative with paternal half-sisters than with nonkin. Furthermore, paternal kin discrimination was more pronounced among peers than among nonpeers, indicating that age proximity has an additional regulatory effect on affiliative interactions. We propose that kin discrimination among cercopithecine primates emerges from ontogenetic processes that involve phenotype matching based on shared behavioral traits, such as inherited personality profiles, rather than physiological or physical characteristics.},

	abstract = {Forming strong social bonds can lead to higher reproductive success, increased longevity, and/or increased infant survival in several mammal species. Given these adaptive benefits, understanding what determines partner preferences in social bonding is important. Maternal relatedness strongly predicts partner preference across many mammalian taxa. The role of paternal relatedness, however, has received relatively little attention, even though paternal and maternal kin share the same number of genes, and theoretically similar preferences would therefore be expected for paternal kin. Here, we investigate the role of maternal and paternal relatedness in female affiliation in Assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis), a species characterized by a relatively low male reproductive skew. We studied a wild population under natural conditions using extensive behavioral data and relatedness analyses based on pedigree reconstruction. We found stronger affiliative relationships and more time spent grooming between maternal kin and paternal half-sisters compared with nonkin, with no preference of maternal over paternal kin. Paternally related and nonrelated dyads did not form stronger relationships when they had less close maternal kin available, but we would need a bigger sample size to confirm this. As expected given the low reproductive skew, affiliative relationships between paternal half-sisters closer in age were not stronger than between paternal half-sisters with larger age differences, suggesting that the kin bias toward paternal kin was not mediated by age similarity. An alternative way through which paternal kin could get familiarized is mother- and/or father-mediated familiarity.},

	abstract = {The idea that competition and aggression are central to an understanding of the origins of group-living and sociality among human and nonhuman primates is the dominant theory in primatology today. Using this paradigm, researchers have focused their attention on competitive and aggressive behaviors, and have tended to overlook the importance of cooperative and affiliative behaviors. However, cooperative and affiliative behaviors are considerably more common than agonistic behaviors in all primate species. The current paradigm often fails to explain the context, function, and social tactics underlying affiliative and agonistic behavior. Here, we present data on a basic question of primate sociality: how much time do diurnal, group-living primates spend in social behavior, and how much of this time is affiliative and agonistic? These data are derived from a survey of 81 studies, including 28 genera and 60 species. We find that group-living prosimians, New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, and apes usually devote less than 10\% of their activity budget to active social interactions. Further, rates of agonistic behaviors are extremely low, normally less than 1\% of the activity budget. If the cost to the actors of affiliative behavior is low even if the rewards are low or extremely variable, we should expect affiliation and cooperation to be frequent. This is especially true under conditions in which individuals benefit from the collective environment of living in stable social groups. Am J Phys Anthropol 128:84–97, 2005. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {The social organization of spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) appear remarkably similar. In this paper, field studies of these two species were used to (1) test a model of ecological constraints on animal group size which suggests that group size is a function of travel costs and (2) assess ecological and social factors underlying the social organization of these two species. Spider monkeys were studied over a 6-year period in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica, and chimpanzees were studied for 6 years in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Adults of both species spent their time in small subgroups that frequently changed size and composition. Thus, unlike most primate species, spider monkeys and chimpanzees were not always in a spatially cohesive social group; each individual had the option of associating in subgroups of a different size or composition. Both species relied on ripe fruit from trees that could be depleted through their feeding activity. However, spider monkey food resources tended to occur at higher densities, were more common, less temporally variable, and did not reach the low levels experienced by chimpanzees. Analyses of the relationship between subgroup size and the density and distribution of their food resources suggested that travel costs limit subgroup size. However, these ecological factors did not influence all age/sex classes equally. For example, the number of adult males in a subgroup was a function of food density and travel costs. However, this was not the case for female chimpanzees, suggesting that the benefits of being in a subgroup for females did not exceed the costs, even when ecological conditions appeared to minimize subgroup foraging costs. Therefore, it seems likely that social strategies influenced the relationship between food resource variables and subgroup size.},

	abstract = {A suite of statistical methods are used to study animal movement. Most of these methods treat animal telemetry data in one of three ways: as discrete processes, as continuous processes, or as point processes. We briefly review each of these approaches and then focus in on the latter. In the context of point processes, so-called resource selection analyses are among the most common way to statistically treat animal telemetry data. However, most resource selection analyses provide inference based on approximations of point process models. The forms of these models have been limited to a few types of specifications that provide inference about relative resource use and, less commonly, probability of use. For more general spatio-temporal point process models, the most common type of analysis often proceeds with a data augmentation approach that is used to create a binary data set that can be analyzed with conditional logistic regression. We show that the conditional logistic regression likelihood can be generalized to accommodate a variety of alternative specifications related to resource selection. We then provide an example of a case where a spatio-temporal point process model coincides with that implied by a mechanistic model for movement expressed as a partial differential equation derived from first principles of movement. We demonstrate that inference from this form of point process model is intuitive (and could be useful for management and conservation) by analyzing a set of telemetry data from a mountain lion in Colorado, USA, to understand the effects of spatially explicit environmental conditions on movement behavior of this species.},

	abstract = {Poor research design and data analysis encourage false-positive findings. Such poor methods persist despite perennial calls for improvement, suggesting that they result from something more than just misunderstanding. The persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives that favour them, leading to the natural selection of bad science. This dynamic requires no conscious strategizing—no deliberate cheating nor loafing—by scientists, only that publication is a principal factor for career advancement. Some normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further publication instead of discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a shift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding understanding. We support this argument with empirical evidence and computational modelling. We first present a 60-year meta-analysis of statistical power in the behavioural sciences and show that power has not improved despite repeated demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To demonstrate the logical consequences of structural incentives, we then present a dynamic model of scientific communities in which competing laboratories investigate novel or previously published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more ‘progeny,’ such that their methods are more often copied and their students are more likely to start labs of their own. Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and increasingly high false discovery rates. We additionally show that replication slows but does not stop the process of methodological deterioration. Improving the quality of research requires change at the institutional level.},

	abstract = {Research on non-human primates in the endangered tropical dry forest of Sector Santa Rosa (SSR), Área de Conservación Guanacaste (ACG), was launched in 1983 and is now one of the longest running studies of primates globally. Such continuous study provides a rare opportunity to ask questions that are only answerable through decades-long monitoring of these long-lived monkeys. In turn, the mounting data generated by long-term study, including knowledge of lifetime reproductive success, familial relatedness, comprehensive behavioral and dietary repertoires, and patterns of inter- and intra-annual variation in forest productivity, provide diverse opportunities to researchers, and facilitate studies that are of shorter duration. Here, we review some of the contributions of our longitudinal research on white-faced capuchins and Geoffroy's spider monkeys, together with newer studies on mantled howler monkeys. We begin by synthesizing findings from our research on demography, dispersal, social relationships, and reproduction. These life history and social traits interact with their foraging and sensory ecology, which we review next. We end by highlighting how the longitudinal study of primates in Sector Santa Rosa has made direct and indirect contributions to the conservation of the critically endangered dry forest biome and its inhabitants, as well as to education, community, and forest restoration initiatives. In particular, we focus our review on how long-term research is uniquely positioned to make key contributions spanning different topical areas.

Methodological developments for collecting data remotely on social behaviour involve indirect inference of associations, direct recordings of interactions and machine vision. These recent technological advances are improving the scale and resolution with which we can dissect interactions among animals. They are also revealing new intricacies of animal social interactions at spatial and temporal resolutions as well as in ecological contexts that have been hidden from humans, making the unwatchable seeable. We first outline how these technological applications are permitting researchers to collect exquisitely detailed information with little observer bias. We further recognize new emerging challenges from these new reality-mining approaches. While technological advances in automating data collection and its analysis are moving at an unprecedented rate, we urge ecologists to thoughtfully combine these new tools with classic behavioural and ecological monitoring methods to place our understanding of animal social networks within fundamental biological contexts.},

	abstract = {Animal tracking and biologging devices record large amounts of data on individual movement behaviors in natural environments. In these data, movement ecologists often view unexplained variation around the mean as “noise” when studying patterns at the population level. In the field of behavioral ecology, however, focus has shifted from population means to the biological underpinnings of variation around means. Specifically, behavioral ecologists use repeated measures of individual behavior to partition behavioral variability into intrinsic among-individual variation and reversible behavioral plasticity and to quantify: a) individual variation in behavioral types (i.e. different average behavioral expression), b) individual variation in behavioral plasticity (i.e. different responsiveness of individuals to environmental gradients), c) individual variation in behavioral predictability (i.e. different residual within-individual variability of behavior around the mean), and d) correlations among these components and correlations in suites of behaviors, called ‘behavioral syndromes’. We here suggest that partitioning behavioral variability in animal movements will further the integration of movement ecology with other fields of behavioral ecology. We provide a literature review illustrating that individual differences in movement behaviors are insightful for wildlife and conservation studies and give recommendations regarding the data required for addressing such questions. In the accompanying R tutorial we provide a guide to the statistical approaches quantifying the different aspects of among-individual variation. We use movement data from 35 African elephants and show that elephants differ in a) their average behavior for three common movement behaviors, b) the rate at which they adjusted movement over a temporal gradient, and c) their behavioral predictability (ranging from more to less predictable individuals). Finally, two of the three movement behaviors were correlated into a behavioral syndrome (d), with farther moving individuals having shorter mean residence times. Though not explicitly tested here, individual differences in movement and predictability can affect an individual’s risk to be hunted or poached and could therefore open new avenues for conservation biologists to assess population viability. We hope that this review, tutorial, and worked example will encourage movement ecologists to examine the biology of individual variation in animal movements hidden behind the population mean.},

	abstract = {Social network methods have become a key tool for describing, modelling, and testing hypotheses about the social structures of animals. However, due to the non-independence of network data and the presence of confounds, specialized statistical techniques are often needed to test hypotheses in these networks. Datastream permutations, originally developed to test the null hypothesis of random social structure, have become a popular tool for testing a wide array of null hypotheses in animal social networks. In particular, they have been used to test whether exogenous factors are related to network structure by interfacing these permutations with regression models. Here, we show that these datastream permutations typically do not represent the null hypothesis of interest to researchers interfacing animal social network analysis with regression modelling, and use simulations to demonstrate the potential pitfalls of using this methodology. Our simulations show that, if used to indicate whether a relationship exists between network structure and a covariate, datastream permutations can result in extremely high type I error rates, in some cases approaching 50\%. In the same set of simulations, traditional node-label permutations produced appropriate type I error rates ( 5\%). Our analysis shows that datastream permutations do not represent the appropriate null hypothesis for these analyses. We suggest that potential alternatives to this procedure may be found in regarding the problems of non-independence of network data and unreliability of observations separately. If biases introduced during data collection can be corrected, either prior to model fitting or within the model itself, node-label permutations then serve as a useful test for interfacing animal social network analysis with regression modelling.},

	abstract = {Inequality or skew in reproductive success (RS) is common across many animal species and is of long-standing interest to the study of social evolution. However, the measurement of inequality in RS in natural populations has been challenging because existing quantitative measures are highly sensitive to variation in group/sample size, mean RS, and age-structure. This makes comparisons across multiple groups and/or species vulnerable to statistical artefacts and hinders empirical and theoretical progress. Here, we present a new measure of reproductive skew, the multinomial index,
              M
              , that is unaffected by many of the structural biases affecting existing indices.
              M
              is analytically related to Nonacs’ binomial index,
              B
              , and comparably accounts for heterogeneity in age across individuals; in addition,
              M
              allows for the possibility of diminishing or even highly nonlinear RS returns to age. Unlike
              B
              , however,
              M
              is not biased by differences in sample/group size. To demonstrate the value of our index for cross-population comparisons, we conduct a reanalysis of male reproductive skew in 31 primate species. We show that a previously reported negative effect of group size on mating skew was an artefact of structural biases in existing skew measures, which inevitably decline with group size; this bias disappears when using
              M
              . Applying phylogenetically controlled, mixed-effects models to the same dataset, we identify key similarities and differences in the inferred within- and between-species predictors of reproductive skew across metrics. Finally, we provide an R package,

Using game theoretic modelling, we predict that individuals of all ranks will invest more in cooperation and less in social conflict in harsh environments than individuals of the same ranks in benign environments. Counterintuitively, low-ranking subordinates should increase their investment in cooperation proportionally more than high-ranking dominants, suggesting that subordinates contribute relatively more when facing environmental challenges. We then test and confirm these predictions experimentally using the Asian burying beetle
              Nicrophorus nepalensis

Socio-ecological factors are likely to influence social complexity, but no attempt has been made to explain the differentiation of social relationships using multiple socio-ecological factors. Here, we propose a conceptual framework based on four components underlying multiple socio-ecological factors that influence the differentiation of social relationships: the extent of within-group contest competition to access resources, the extent to which individuals differ in their ability to provide a variety of services, the need for group-level cooperation and the constraints on social interactions. We use the framework to make predictions about the degree of relationship differentiation that can be expected within a group according to the cumulative contribution of multiple socio-ecological factors to each of the four components. The framework has broad applicability, since the four components are likely to be relevant to a wide range of animal taxa and to additional socio-ecological factors not explicitly dealt with here. Hence, the framework can be used as the basis for the development of novel and testable hypotheses about intra- and interspecific differences in relationship differentiation and social complexity.},

These contrasts in philopatry and dispersal have an important consequence on the kinship structure of groups which, in turn, affects forms of social relationships between females. As yet, there is still widespread disagreement over the reasons for the evolution of habitual female dispersal, partly as a result of contrasting definitions of dispersal. This paper reviews variation in the frequency with which females leave their natal group or range (social dispersal) and argues that both the avoidance of local competition for resources and breeding opportunities and the need to find unrelated partners play an important role in contrasts between and within species.},

	abstract = {Across group-living animals, linear dominance hierarchies lead to disparities in access to resources, health outcomes and reproductive performance. Studies of how dominance rank predicts these traits typically employ one of several dominance rank metrics without examining the assumptions each metric makes about its underlying competitive processes. Here, we compare the ability of two dominance rank metrics—simple ordinal rank and proportional or ‘standardized’ rank—to predict 20 traits in a wild baboon population in Amboseli, Kenya. We propose that simple ordinal rank best predicts traits when competition is density-dependent, whereas proportional rank best predicts traits when competition is density-independent. We found that for 75\% of traits (15/20), one rank metric performed better than the other. Strikingly, all male traits were best predicted by simple ordinal rank, whereas female traits were evenly split between proportional and simple ordinal rank. Hence, male and female traits are shaped by different competitive processes: males are largely driven by density-dependent resource access (e.g. access to oestrous females), whereas females are shaped by both density-independent (e.g. distributed food resources) and density-dependent resource access. This method of comparing how different rank metrics predict traits can be used to distinguish between different competitive processes operating in animal societies.},

	abstract = {OUTLINEDespite their small size (2–1000 g), bats have life-cycles comparable to those of much larger mammals, characterized by longevity, low fecundity and substantial parental care (Barclay \&amp; Harder, 2003). They also have very diverse life-cycles, with considerable variation in social systems and mating strategies (Altringham, 1996; McCracken \&amp; Wilkinson, 2000). There are currently believed to be almost 1100 species in 18 families, dominated by 5 very large families: Vespertilionidae, Rhinolophidae, Molossidae, Phyllostomidae and Pteropodidae (Koopman, 1993). Most species have not been studied, but enough is known about a small but varied minority to begin to understand the significance of the different social structures seen in bats.Although a common feature in many mammals and often seen in sexually segregated species, marked sexual dimorphism in bats is rare. Female microbats are typically a little larger than males, but the differences are frequently only statistically significant with large sample sizes. One exception is Ametrida centurio, in which the females are markedly larger than the males (Peterson, 1965). The few instances of marked dimorphism are usually adaptations for sexual signalling, such as the enlarged nasal cavities of male hammer-headed bats, Hypsignathus monstrosus, and the erectile and scented hairs of the crested free-tailed bat, Chaerephon chapini (Altringham \&amp; Fenton, 2003).So why do bats segregate by sex? Sexual segregation has been given relatively little attention in bats despite their diversity, their tendency to form large social units and indeed their tendency to segregate.},

	abstract = {The spatial organization of a population can influence the spread of information, behaviour and pathogens. Group territory size and territory overlap and components of spatial organization, provide key information as these metrics may be indicators of habitat quality, resource dispersion, contact rates and environmental risk (e.g. indirectly transmitted pathogens). Furthermore, sociality and behaviour can also shape space use, and subsequently, how space use and habitat quality together impact demography. Our study aims to identify factors shaping the spatial organization of wildlife populations and assess the impact of epizootics on space use. We further aim to explore the mechanisms by which disease perturbations could cause changes in spatial organization. Here we assessed the seasonal spatial organization of Serengeti lions and Yellowstone wolves at the group level. We use network analysis to describe spatial organization and connectivity of social groups. We then examine the factors predicting mean territory size and mean territory overlap for each population using generalized additive models. We demonstrate that lions and wolves were similar in that group-level factors, such as number of groups and shaped spatial organization more than population-level factors, such as population density. Factors shaping territory size were slightly different than factors shaping territory overlap; for example, wolf pack size was an important predictor of territory overlap, but not territory size. Lion spatial networks were more highly connected, while wolf spatial networks varied seasonally. We found that resource dispersion may be more important for driving territory size and overlap for wolves than for lions. Additionally, canine distemper epizootics may have altered lion spatial organization, highlighting the importance of including infectious disease epizootics in studies of behavioural and movement ecology. We provide insight about when we might expect to observe the impacts of resource dispersion, disease perturbations, and other ecological factors on spatial organization. Our work highlights the importance of monitoring and managing social carnivore populations at the group level. Future research should elucidate the complex relationships between demographics, social and spatial structure, abiotic and biotic conditions and pathogen infections.},

Most species demonstrating this relationship exhibit complex forms of social bonds and interactions. However, female eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) exhibit differentiated social relationships, yet do not appear to cooperate directly. It is unclear what the fitness consequences of such sociability could be in species that do not exhibit obvious forms of cooperation. Using 4 years of life history, spatial and social data from a wild population of approximately 200 individually recognizable female eastern grey kangaroos, we tested whether higher levels of sociability are associated with greater reproductive success. Contrary to expectations, we found that the size of a female's social network, her numbers of preferential associations with other females and her group sizes all negatively influenced her reproductive success. These factors influenced the survival of dependent young that had left the pouch rather than those that were still in the pouch. We also show that primiparous females (first-time breeders) were less likely to have surviving young. Our findings suggest that social bonds are not always beneficial for reproductive success in group-living species, and that female kangaroos may experience trade-offs between successfully rearing young and maintaining affiliative relationships.},

Social network analysis comprises a collection of analytical tools rooted in the framework of graph theory that were developed to study human social interaction patterns. More recently these techniques have been successfully applied to examine animal societies. Primate social systems differ from those of humans in both size and density, requiring an approach that puts more emphasis on the quality of relationships. Here, we discuss a set of network measures that are useful to describe primate social organization and we present the results of a network analysis of 70 groups from 30 different species. For this purpose we concentrated on structural measures on the group level, describing the distribution of interaction patterns, centrality, and group structuring. We found considerable variability in those measures, reﬂecting the high degree of diversity of primate social organizations. By characterizing primate groups in terms of their network metrics we can draw a much ﬁner picture of their internal structure that might be useful for species comparisons as well as the interpretation of social behavior.},

	abstract = {Long-term relationships that underlie many stable mammalian groups often occur between philopatric kin. Although stable groups of nonrelatives appear to be less common, there is increasing evidence that social bonds between nonkin may confer sufficient intrinsic fitness benefits for these groups to persist. Here we evaluate whether social stability occurs in a bisexually dispersing species where social bonds have been shown to have reproductive benefits: the feral horse, Equus caballus. First, we quantified female social stability by applying a three-level framework to a 3-year data set of associations in semiferal ponies; this tested for stability at the individual, dyadic and subpopulation levels. Despite the relative weakness of these female bonds, we found significant social stability across all levels, as shown by stable association preferences, social networks and individual network positions. Second, we investigated how seasonality impacts on social bond strength and grouping patterns. We found seasonal fluctuations in female gregariousness, with a peak during the mating season. We therefore propose that significant social stability in female horses is coupled with a degree of flexibility that allows for effects of ecological fluctuations. Although social network analysis is widely used in behavioural ecological research, this is one of only a handful of studies to assess the temporal dynamics of networks over a significant timescale. Temporal stability in female relationships suggests that equid social structures are multifaceted: although bonds between stallions and mares are clearly strong, long-term relationships between mares underpin the social network structure. We suggest this framework could be used to assess social stability in other group-living species in order to improve our understanding of the nature of social bonds.},

	abstract = {In several group-living species, individuals' social preferences are thought to be influenced by cooperation. For some societies with fission–fusion dynamics, sex-specific association patterns reflect sex differences in cooperation in within- and between-group contexts. In our study, we investigated this hypothesis further by comparing sex-specific association patterns in two closely related species, chimpanzees and bonobos, which differ in the level of between-group competition and in the degree to which sex and kinship influence dyadic cooperation. Here, we used long-term party composition data collected on five chimpanzee and two bonobo communities and assessed, for each individual of 10 years and older, the sex of its top associate and of all conspecifics with whom it associated more frequently than expected by chance. We found clear species differences in association patterns. While in all chimpanzee communities males and females associated more with same-sex partners, in bonobos males and females tended to associate preferentially with females, but the female association preference for other females is lower than in chimpanzees. Our results also show that, for bonobos (but not for chimpanzees), association patterns were predominantly driven by mother–offspring relationships. These species differences in association patterns reflect the high levels of male–male cooperation in chimpanzees and of mother–son cooperation in bonobos. Finally, female chimpanzees showed intense association with a few other females, and male chimpanzees showed more uniform association across males. In bonobos, the most differentiated associations were from males towards females. Chimpanzee male association patterns mirror fundamental human male social traits and, as in humans, may have evolved as a response to strong between-group competition. The lack of such a pattern in a closely related species with a lower degree of between-group competition further supports this notion.},

	abstract = {The life histories of organisms can show pronounced variation in the way that the costs of reproduction are financed. To facilitate discussions of this variation, two terms are increasing in use: “capital breeding” describes the situation in which reproduction is financed using stored capital; “income breeding” refers to the use of concurrent intake to pay for a reproductive attempt. We consider the value of the capital and income typology with reference to three functions that it might serve: description, explanation, and prediction. We find that interpretations of the terms have diversified and lack rigidity, leading to subjectivity in their definition. We recognize that time frames of interest will vary among taxa, but we urge consistency of use within those taxa. We also urge consistency in the use of a single metric designed to measure the reliance of an organism on capital. The concepts of capital and income breeding have served well as proximate explanations for behavioral or physiological diversity, but efforts to explain their adaptive value have been disproportionately focused on individual taxa. Mapping cause to effect is difficult in ecology. Nevertheless, further analyses, based on consistently applied measures of reliance on stored capital, may reveal which of the putative ecological, morphological, and physiological drivers have the most consistent and widespread effects. The capital–income typology has yet to be applied to the question of prediction, and thus, it remains to be seen whether these concepts will be of use in identifying the likely responses of different populations to changes in their environment.},

	abstract = {Seasonal reproduction is common among mammals at all latitudes, even in the deep tropics. This paper (i) discusses the neuroendocrine pathways via which foraging conditions and predictive cues such as photoperiod enforce seasonality, (ii) considers the kinds of seasonal challenges mammals actually face in natural habitats, and (iii) uses the information thus generated to suggest how seasonal reproduction might be influenced by global climate change. Food availability and ambient temperature determine energy balance, and variation in energy balance is the ultimate cause of seasonal breeding in all mammals and the proximate cause in many. Photoperiodic cueing is common among long-lived mammals from the highest latitudes down to the mid-tropics. It is much less common in shorter lived mammals at all latitudes. An unknown predictive cue triggers reproduction in some desert and dry grassland species when it rains. The available information suggests that as our climate changes the small rodents of the world may adapt rather easily but the longer lived mammals whose reproduction is regulated by photoperiod may not do so well. A major gap in our knowledge concerns the tropics; that is where most species live and where we have the least understanding of how reproduction is regulated by environmental factors.},

	abstract = {The baboons (Papio sp.) exhibit marked interspecies variation in social behavior. The thesis presented here argues, ﬁrst, that male philopatry is a crucial factor, arguably the crucial factor, underlying the other distinctive features (one-male units, multilevel society) shared by hamadryas and Guinea baboons, but not other species of Papio. The second suggestion is that male philopatry as a population norm was not an adaptation to a particular habitat or set of ecological circumstances but evolved in the common ancestor of hamadryas and Guinea baboons as a response to natural selection in the demographic context peculiar to the frontier of a rapidly expanding population. Other derived features of social structure (male-male tolerance, some facultative female dispersal) subsequently evolved to accommodate male philopatry. The mitochondrial genetic population structure of extant baboons preserves a footprint of the initial expansion of ‘modern’ Papio. Immediately after the expansion, male-philopatric, multilevel populations with a general physical and behavioral resemblance to Guinea baboons occupied the whole northern hemisphere range of the genus. Behavioral and physical autapomorphies of hamadryas baboons evolved in a subpopulation of this ancestral northern base, in response to a less productive habitat of the Horn of Africa. Subsequently, ancestral olive baboons ‘reinvented’ male dispersal. They and yellow baboons, another male-dispersing species, then replaced most of the malephilopatric northern populations, by male-driven introgression and nuclear swamping.},

	abstract = {Long-term maleefemale bonds and bi-parental investment in offspring are hallmarks of human society. A key question is how these traits evolved from the polygynandrously mating multimale multifemale society that likely characterized the Pan-Homo ancestor. In all three species of savanna baboons, lactating females form strong ties (sometimes called “friendships”) with one or more adult males. For yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus) and chacma baboons (Papio ursinus), several lines of evidence suggest that these relationships are a form of male parenting effort. In olive baboons (Papio anubis), females are thought to preferentially mate with their “friends”, and male-female bonds may thus function as a form of mating effort. Here, we draw on behavioral and genetic data to evaluate the factors that shape malefemale relationships in a well-studied population of olive baboons. We ﬁnd support for the parenting effort hypothesis in that sires have stronger bonds with their infants' mothers than do other males. These bonds sometimes persist past weaning age and, in many cases, the sire of the previous infant is still a close partner of the female when she nurses her subsequent offspring. We ﬁnd that males who have the strongest bonds with females that have resumed cycling, but are not currently sexually receptive, are more likely to sire the female's next offspring but the estimate is associated with large statistical uncertainty. We also ﬁnd that in over one third of the cases, a female's successive infants were sired by the same male. Thus, in olive baboons, the development of stable breeding bonds and paternal investment seem to be grounded in the formation of close ties between males and anestrous females. However, other factors such as male dominance rank also inﬂuence paternity success and may preclude stability of these bonds to the extent found in human societies.},

Here, we approach the question of anthropoid fruit foraging adaptations in light of the sensory and mechanical properties of anthropoid-consumed fruits in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We quantify the color, odor, size, and puncture resistance of fruits in Kibale that are consumed by anthropoid primates (N = 44) and compare these with the same traits of fruits that are not consumed by anthropoid primates (N = 24). Contrary to extant hypotheses, color and odor of anthropoidconsumed fruits do not differ from non-anthropoid–consumed fruits. However, we find that anthropoids in this system consume fruits that are significantly larger than nonanthropoid–consumed fruits, and with the exception of elephants that consume very large fruits, are the only dispersers of fruits with a surface area {\textless}4032 mm2, and a maximum diameter of 52 mm. While our findings do not support most extant hypotheses for the evolution of derived anthropoid primate traits as adaptations to ripe fruit foraging, we find some evidence to support the hypothesis that spatulate incisors may be an adaptation to foraging on large fruits, which tend to be harder.},

	abstract = {Social preferences in pigs have received little attention despite the welfare implication of providing an adequate social environment for farm animals. We investigated the extent to which domestic pigs show affiliative preferences in three behavioural contexts—rest, exploration, social nosing—and whether these preferences were influenced by sex, relatedness and social dominance. We recorded the frequency at which pigs were associated in close spatial proximity during rest (≤30 cm) and exploration (≤1 m), and engaged in social nosing interactions (snout- snout and snout-body contacts) from age 23–29 weeks. The group consisted of 24 pigs from three mixed-sex litters of the same age, housed in an indoor pen and having free access to a large pasture area. To test for dyadic social preferences, we calculated associations in close proximity and social nosing interaction rates, classified them by strength and tested their significance with permutation methods. We then used the Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure to test whether individual traits (sex, litter, dominance) and other social interactions (agonistic interactions, active lying down) explained the preferred partners. Preferences were overall relatively weak but found across all behavioural contexts—of all observed pairs, 44 \% were preferred pairs when resting, 20 \% when exploring, and 30 \% when social nosing (snout-body contact). Snout-body contacts were weakly and negatively correlated with sex and dominance, whereas close proximity associations during rest and social nosing interactions were positively correlated with active lying down behaviour. Our results indicate that domestic pigs can develop preferred social relationships, and that such social preferences are weakly driven by individual attributes (sex and dominance) but influenced by the behavioural context. By shedding light on underexplored aspects of the social structure of pigs, our study strengthens the importance of accounting for the multiple drivers of social relationships to provide an adequate environment that improves management and welfare of pigs.},

First, we showed using a bootstrapping method, that uncertainty of ad libitum grooming and play matrices were lesser than uncertainty of focal matrices. Nevertheless, grooming and play networks constructed from ad libitum and focal animal sampling were very similar and highly correlated. We improved the certainty of both grooming and play networks by pooling focal and ad libitum matrices. Second, we reported a high correlation between the proximity armlength network and the focal grooming one making an arm‐length proximity network a reasonable proxy for a grooming one in vervet monkeys. However, we did not find such a correlation between proximity networks and the play one.

Many real-world networks are sparse and hierarchical, with m∼n and d∼logn, in which case our algorithm runs in essentially linear time, O(nlog2n). As an example of the application of this algorithm we use it to analyze a network of items for sale on the web site of a large on-line retailer, items in the network being linked if they are frequently purchased by the same buyer. The network has more than 400 000 vertices and 2×106 edges. We show that our algorithm can extract meaningful communities from this network, revealing large-scale patterns present in the purchasing habits of customers.},

	abstract = {Following Darwin's original insights regarding sexual selection, studies of intrasexual competition have mainly focused on male competition for mates; by contrast, female reproductive competition has received less attention. Here, we review evidence that female mammals compete for both resources and mates in order to secure reproductive benefits. We describe how females compete for resources such as food, nest sites, and protection by means of dominance relationships, territoriality and inter-group aggression, and by inhibiting the reproduction of other females. We also describe evidence that female mammals compete for mates and consider the ultimate causes of such behaviour, including competition for access to resources provided by mates, sperm limitation and prevention of future resource competition. Our review reveals female competition to be a potentially widespread and significant evolutionary selection pressure among mammals, particularly competition for resources among social species for which most evidence is currently available. We report that female competition is associated with many diverse adaptations, from overtly aggressive behaviour, weaponry, and conspicuous sexual signals to subtle and often complex social behaviour involving olfactory signalling, alliance formation, altruism and spite, and even cases where individuals appear to inhibit their own reproduction. Overall, despite some obvious parallels with male phenotypic traits favoured under sexual selection, it appears that fundamental differences in the reproductive strategies of the sexes (ultimately related to parental investment) commonly lead to contrasting competitive goals and adaptations. Because female adaptations for intrasexual competition are often less conspicuous than those of males, they are generally more challenging to study. In particular, since females often employ competitive strategies that directly influence not only the number but also the quality (survival and reproductive success) of their own offspring, as well as the relative reproductive success of others, a multigenerational view ideally is required to quantify the full extent of variation in female fitness resulting from intrasexual competition. Nonetheless, current evidence indicates that the reproductive success of female mammals can also be highly variable over shorter time scales, with significant reproductive skew related to competitive ability. Whether we choose to describe the outcome of female reproductive competition (competition for mates, for mates controlling resources, or for resources per se) as sexual selection depends on how sexual selection is defined. Considering sexual selection strictly as resulting from differential mating or fertilisation success, the role of female competition for the sperm of preferred (or competitively successful) males appears particularly worthy of more detailed investigation. Broader definitions of sexual selection have recently been proposed to encompass the impact on reproduction of competition for resources other than mates. Although the merits of such definitions are a matter of ongoing debate, our review highlights that understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of female reproductive competition indeed requires a broader perspective than has traditionally been assumed. We conclude that future research in this field offers much exciting potential to address new and fundamentally important questions relating to social and mating-system evolution.},

	abstract = {Social hierarchies are widespread in human and animal societies, and an individual’s position in its hierarchy affects both its access to resources and its fitness. Hierarchies are traditionally thought of in terms of variation in individual ability to win fights, but many are structured around arbitrary conventions like nepotistic inheritance rather than such traits as physical strength or weapon size. These convention-based societies are perplexing because position in the hierarchy appears to be gained irrespective of individual physical ability, yet social status strongly affects access to resources and fitness. It remains unclear why individuals abide by seemingly arbitrary conventions regarding social status when they stand to benefit by ignoring these conventions and competing for top positions or access to resources. Using data from wild spotted hyenas collected over 27 y and five generations, we show that individuals who repeatedly form coalitions with their top allies are likely to improve their position in the hierarchy, suggesting that social alliances facilitate revolutionary social change. Using lifetime reproductive success as a fitness measure, we go on to demonstrate that these status changes can have major fitness consequences. Finally, we show that the consequences of these changes may become even more dramatic over multiple generations, as small differences in social rank become amplified over time. This work represents a first step in reconciling the advantages of high status with the appearance of “arbitrary” conventions that structure inequality in animal and human societies.},

                Because of the nature of social interaction or association data, when testing hypotheses using social network data it is common for network studies to rely on permutations to control for confounding variables, and to not also control for them in the fitted statistical model. This can be a problem because it does not adjust for any bias in effect sizes generated by these confounding effects, and thus the effect sizes are not informative in the presence of counfouding variables.
              
              
                We implemented two network simulation examples and analysed an empirical data set to demonstrate how relying solely on permutations to control for confounding variables can result in highly biased effect size estimates of animal social preferences that are uninformative when quantifying differences in behaviour.
              
              
                Using these simulations, we show that this can sometimes even lead to effect sizes that have the wrong sign and are thus the effect size is not biologically interpretable. We demonstrate how this problem can be addressed by controlling for confounding variables in the statistical dyadic or nodal model.
              
              
                We recommend this approach should be adopted as standard practice in the statistical analysis of animal social network data.},

	abstract = {This study quantifies the effects of low—intensity logging (affecting {\textless} 10\% of the forest surface) on leaf chemistry, leaf and fruit production, and their effects on lemurs in a dry deciduous forest in western Madagascar. Logging exposed the remaining trees to more sunlight. Within a single tree among trees, this resulted in higher protein concentrations in sun—exposed leaves, while fiber content remained constant. Concentrations of condensed tannins were also higher at higher sun exposure, but they leveled off at lower light intensities before protein and sugar concentrations. Within the 2—yr study period, crown extension due to higher availability of sunlight could compensate only for parts of the crown area lost due to logging. Thus, the biomass of leaves available was reduced, while average leaf quality (measured as the ratio of protein to fiber) increased. Fruit production was also positively correlated with sun exposure to the tree crown. Since fruits of the main timber trees (Commiphora spp.) are rarely consumed by frugivorous lemurs, removal of these trees increases sun exposure of other potential food trees for frugivores. At the described level of logging intensity, sightings of all lemur species increased (significantly in three out of seven species at P {\textless} 0.05) compared to the pre—logging state and two control plots. This increase was attributed to increased fruit production and higher protein concentration in sun—exposed leaves. In natural forests, treefall gaps may have effects similar to those of logging in the present study. Low level disturbances, in general, may be important for the carrying capacity for folivorous and frugivorous lemurs and possibly for most primates.},

	abstract = {Lice are socially-transmitted ectoparasites. Transmission depends upon their host’s degree of contact with conspecifics. While grooming facilitates ectoparasite transmission via body contact, it also constrains their spread through parasite removal. We investigated relations between parasite burden and sociality in female Japanese macaques following two opposing predictions: i) central females in contact/grooming networks harbour more lice, related to their numerous contacts; ii) central females harbour fewer lice, related to receiving more grooming. We estimated lice load non-invasively using the conspicuous louse egg-picking behaviour performed by macaques during grooming. We tested for covariation in several centrality measures and lice load, controlling for season, female reproductive state and dominance rank. Results show that the interaction between degree centrality (number of partners) and seasonality predicted lice load: females interacting with more partners had fewer lice than those interacting with fewer partners in winter and summer, whereas there was no relationship between lice load and centrality in spring and fall. This is counter to the prediction that increased contact leads to greater louse burden but fits the prediction that social grooming limits louse burden. Interactions between environmental seasonality and both parasite and host biology appeared to mediate the role of social processes in louse burden.},

Whilst many studies have investigated how morphological traits such as size affect social structure of populations, comparatively little is known about the influence of behaviours such as boldness and shyness. Using information on social interactions in a wild population of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), we construct a social network. For each individual in the network, we quantify its behavioural phenotype using two measures of boldness, predator inspection tendency, a repeatable and reliably measured behaviour well studied in the context of co-operation, and shoaling tendency. We observe striking heterogeneity in contact patterns, with strong ties being positively assorted and weak ties negatively assorted by our measured behavioural traits. Moreover, shy fish had more network connections than bold fish and these were on average stronger. In other words, social fine structure is strongly influenced by behavioural trait. We assert that such structure will have implications for the outcome of selection on behavioural traits and we speculate that the observed positive assortment may act as an amplifier of selection contributing to the maintenance of co-operation during predator inspection.},

In the context of reduced population density, an ideal free-distribution model predicts landscape use should contract to the most productive habitats, and people should avoid areas that show more signs of extensive prior use. However, ecological or social facilitation due to Allee effects (positive density dependence) would predict that the intensity of past habitat use should correlate positively with habitat use. We analyzed fire footprints and fire mosaics from the accumulation of several years of landscape use visible on a 35,300-km2 mosaic of aerial photographs covering much of contemporary Indigenous Martu Native Title Lands imaged between May and August 1953. Structural equation modeling revealed that, consistent with an Allee ideal free distribution, there was a positive relationship between the extent of fire mosaics and the intensity of recent use, and this was consistent across habitats regardless of their quality. Fire mosaics build up in regions with low cost of access to water, high intrinsic food availability, and good access to trade opportunities; these mosaics (constrained by water access during the winter) then draw people back in subsequent years or seasons, largely independent of intrinsic habitat quality. Our results suggest that the positive feedback effects of landscape burning can substantially change the way people value landscapes, affecting mobility and settlement by increasing sedentism and local population density.},

              The results of the various studies in this volume lead to a series of predictions about the relationships of group size to various components of food intake. Individuals in larger groups should generally encounter fewer new food sources per unit foraging effort than they would alone (prediction 1); an exception may occur when large groups defend areas of high food density against small groups. In addition, individuals in larger groups generally will suffer reduced intake per food source encountered because of increased sharing with other group members, at least for food sources that supply little total nutrient relative to an individual's satiation level for the nutrient (prediction 3) or are scarce relative to the spacing between individuals in the group (prediction 5). Individuals in larger groups may compensate for such reductions in foraging efficiency by increasing rates of food encounter (prediction 2), using food sources with greater amounts of nutrient (prediction 4), or increasing total foraging effort per day (prediction 6). Reduced foraging efficiency for a particular nutrient may not affect total intake of that nutrient if other nutrients require greater daily foraging effort (prediction 7). Food competition is expected to be highest in species using small and scarce food sources, subject to a high risk of predation, and with large satiation levels. An appendix on statistical problems describes some of the pitfalls inherent in studies of the kind presented in this volume.},

	abstract = {Social systems are the outcomes of natural and sexual selection on individuals’ efforts to maximize reproductive success. Ecological conditions, life history, demography traits and social aspects have been recognized as important factors shaping social systems. Delphinids show a wide range of social structures and large variation in life history traits and inhabit several aquatic environments. They are therefore an excellent group in which to investigate the interplay of ecological and intrinsic factors on the evolution of mammalian social systems in these environments. Here I synthetize results from genetic studies on dispersal patterns, genetic relatedness, kin associations and mating patterns and combine with ecological, life history and phylogenetic data to predict the formation of kin associations and bonding in these animals. I show that environment type impacts upon dispersal tendencies, with small delphinids generally exhibiting female-biased philopatry in inshore waters and bisexual dispersal in coastal and pelagic waters. When female philopatry occurs, they develop moderate social bonds with related females. Male bonding occurs in species with small male-biased sexual size dimorphism and male-biased operational sex ratio, and it is independent of dispersal tendencies. By contrast, large delphinids, which live in coastal and pelagic waters, show bisexual philopatry and live in matrilineal societies. I propose that sexual conflict favoured the formation of these stable societies and in turn facilitated the development of kin-biased behaviours. Studies on populations of the same species inhabiting disparate environments, and of less related species living in similar habitats, would contribute towards a comprehensive framework for the evolution of delphinid social systems.},

                Social network methods have become a key tool for describing, modelling, and testing hypotheses about the social structures of animals. However, due to the non-independence of network data and the presence of confounds, specialized statistical techniques are often needed to test hypotheses in these networks. Datastream permutations, originally developed to test the null hypothesis of random social structure, have become a popular tool for testing a wide array of null hypotheses. In particular, they have been used to test whether exogenous factors are related to network structure by interfacing these permutations with regression models.
              
              
                Here, we show that these datastream permutations typically do not represent the null hypothesis of interest to researchers interfacing animal social network analysis with regression modelling, and use simulations to demonstrate the potential pitfalls of using this methodology.
              
              
                Our simulations show that utilizing common datastream permutations to test the coefficients of regression models can lead to extremely high type I (false-positive) error rates ({\textgreater} 30\%) in the presence of non-random social structure. The magnitude of this problem is primarily dependent on the degree of non-randomness within the social structure and the intensity of sampling
              
              
                We strongly recommend against utilizing datastream permutations to test regression models in animal social networks. We suggest that a potential solution may be found in regarding the problems of non-independence of network data and unreliability of observations as separate problems with distinct solutions.},

Here, we develop capture-recapture models to analyse network data while accounting for imperfect and heterogeneous detection. We carry out a simulation study to validate our approach. In addition, we show how the visualisation of networks and the calculation of standard metrics can account for detection probabilities. The method is illustrated with data from a population of Commerson’s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus commersonii) in Patagonia Argentina.

	abstract = {Primates display broad diversity in their social organization. The social groups of a few primate species are organized in a multilevel fashion, with large groups composed of multiple, core one‐male units (OMUs). A characteristic of multilevel societies is that the higher levels can include hundreds of individuals. The Rwenzori black‐and‐white colobus (Colobus angolensis ruwenzorii) in the montane forests of Rwanda form supergroups and have been suspected to exhibit multilevel social organization. Here we present the first data on the “anatomy” of a supergroup numbering 500+ individuals. We identified subgroups within the supergroup based on progression data, extracting the social network structure from the time‐stamped spatiotemporal distribution of passing individuals identified to age–sex class, and selecting an optimal time window for each network using the two‐step approach developed by Uddin, Choudhury, Farhad, and Rahman (2017). We detail the existence of core units—multi‐male units (MMUs) with a mean of 1.7 adult males and 3.1 adult females, as well as OMUs, all‐female units and bachelor units composed of adult and sub‐adult males. More than two‐thirds of units are MMUs. These grouping patterns conform to a multilevel society with predominantly multi‐male core units, a social system that has recently also been described for a population of the same taxon in Uganda. Individual identification will be required to corroborate these interpretations.},

We aimed to characterize age-specific variation in maternal allocation and assess the relationship between maternal allocation and other static and dynamic maternal features. Mass measurements of 531 mothers and pups were used with Bayesian hierarchical models to explain the relationship between diverse maternal attributes and both the proportion of mass allocated by Weddell seal mothers, and the efficiency of mass transfer from mother to pup during lactation as well as the weaning mass of pups. Our results demonstrated that maternal mass was strongly and positively associated with the relative reserves allocated by a mother and a pup’s weaning mass but that the efficiency of mass transfer declines with maternal parturition mass. Birthdate was positively associated with proportion mass allocation and pup weaning mass, but mass transfer efficiency was predicted to be highest at the mean birthdate. The relative allocation of maternal reserves declined with maternal age but the efficiency of mass transfer to pups increases, suggestive of selective disappearance of poor-quality mothers. These findings highlight the importance of considering multiple maternal features when assessing variation in maternal allocation.},

	abstract = {Natural disasters can cause rapid demographic changes that disturb the social structure of a population as individuals may lose connections. These changes also have indirect effects as survivors alter their within-group connections or move between groups. As group membership and network position may influence individual fitness, indirect effects may affect how individuals and populations recover from catastrophic events. Here we study changes in the social structure after a large predation event in a population of wild house mice (Mus musculus domesticus), when a third of adults were lost. Using social network analysis, we examine how heterogeneity in sociality results in varied responses to losing connections. We then investigate how these differences influence the overall network structure. An individual's reaction to losing associates depended on its sociality prior to the event. Those that were less social before formed more weak connections afterwards, while more social individuals reduced the number of survivors they associated with. Otherwise, the number and size of social groups were highly robust. This indicates that social preferences can drive how individuals adjust their social behaviour after catastrophic turnover events, despite the population's resilience in social structure.},

These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.},

In the neotropical fringe-lipped bat, Trachops cirrhosus, social transmission of foraging behaviour is clearly demonstrated in captivity, yet its social structure in the wild remains unclear. Here, we used microsatellite-based estimates of relatedness and records of 157 individually marked adults from 106 roost captures over 6 years, to infer whether male and female T. cirrhosus have preferred co-roosting associations and whether such associations were influenced by relatedness. Using a null model that controlled for year and roosting location, we found that both male and female T. cirrhosus have preferred roosting partners, but that only females demonstrate kin-biased association. Most roosting groups (67\%) contained multiple females with one or two reproductive males. Relatedness patterns and recapture records corroborate genetic evidence for female philopatry and male dispersal. Our study adds to growing evidence that many bats demonstrate preferred roosting associations, which has the potential to influence social information transfer.},

	abstract = {In tropical forest systems tree community change after initial succession (approximately 50–100years) is very difficult to detect because of the very slow pace of transformation. Since the mid 1980s, there has been an accumulation of evidence that many forests traditionally considered old growth or mature forests have been disturbed. Using 18years of data on forest change in Kibale National Park, Uganda, we tested the following hypotheses. Species that frequently recruit only into areas of large-scale disturbance (e.g., conversion to agriculture) (1) have a more strongly negative annualized rate of population change (i.e., recruitment is less than mortality) than trees recruiting into the understory or canopy treefall gaps and (2) these species are declining in their average cumulative diameter at breast height (DBH). Both hypotheses were verified. We then examined relationships between forest change and diets of the five diurnal primates in Kibale. The emergent patterns suggest that forest change will lead to declines in some species, particularly the black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza). We concluded that what was considered mature forest in Kibale has actually been disturbed in the recent past, and we discuss how potential sources of disturbance (dry-periods, elephant population fluctuations, and human disturbance) may affect both forest change and animal populations. We assess how such information might be useful in forest management.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests and the animals they support are being threatened by accelerating rates of forest conversion and degradation. In a continually fluctuating sociopolitical world, it is often impossible to protect areas from such conversion until the political environment is suitable to pursue conservation goals, by which time, the forests have often been converted to other uses. This reality suggests a need for inquiry into which primate species can persist after different types of disturbances and how quickly primate communities can recover from disturbance. Here we examine the persistence of primate populations in disturbed habitats by providing a case study of patterns of primate abundance in areas of Kibale National Park (766 km2), Uganda, that have been modified by different types and intensities of human activities, primarily commercial logging and agricultural clearing. Distributional surveys at 24 sites and detailed line-transect censuses at six sites demonstrate that primate populations in Kibale are often high and suggest that patterns of population change associated with disturbance are complex. Analysis of the land use coverage of Kibale reveals that abandoned farms (10.3\%) and degraded forest (8.7\%) now cover 146 km2. Unfortunately, we do not know what proportion of the farms were established on areas that were forest versus grassland. However, if the areas that are now abandoned farms were all once forested, this means that 79 km2 of forest has been lost. Based on density estimates from nearby sites, this would represent a loss of 52,612 monkeys and 200 chimpanzees. Populations would also have been affected by the degradation of the 66 km2 (8.7\%) of forest. These estimates of the potential reductions in the primate populations that could have resulted from forest clearing and degradation illustrate the importance of protecting land. A review of the literature illustrates that the biomass of primates found within Kibale is very high in comparison to other locations and thus illustrates the importance of Kibale to regional conservation.

	abstract = {Cortisol, a key product of the stress response, has critical influences on degenerative aging in humans. In turn, cortisol production is affected by senescence of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to progressive dysregulation and increased cortisol exposure. These processes have been studied extensively in industrialized settings, but few comparative data are available from humans and closely related species living in natural environments, where stressors are very different. Here, we examine age-related changes in urinary cortisol in a 20-y longitudinal study of wild chimpanzees (n = 59 adults) in the Kanyawara community of Kibale National Park, Uganda. We tested for three key features of HPA aging identified in many human studies: increased average levels, a blunted diurnal rhythm, and enhanced response to stressors. Using linear mixed models, we found that aging was associated with a blunting of the diurnal rhythm and a significant linear increase in cortisol, even after controlling for changes in dominance rank. These effects did not differ by sex. Aging did not increase sensitivity to energetic stress or social status. Female chimpanzees experienced their highest levels of cortisol during cycling (versus lactation), and this effect increased with age. Male chimpanzees experienced their highest levels when exposed to sexually attractive females, but this effect was diminished by age. Our results indicate that chimpanzees share some key features of HPA aging with humans. These findings suggest that impairments of HPA regulation are intrinsic to the aging process in hominids and are side effects neither of extended human life span nor of atypical environments.},

	abstract = {High social status is often associated with greater mating opportunities and fertility for men, but do women also obtain fitness benefits of high status? Greater resource access and child survivorship may be principal pathways through which social status increases women's fitness. Here, we examine whether peer-rankings of women's social status (indicated by political influence, project leadership, and respect) positively covaries with child nutritional status and health in a community of Amazonian horticulturalists. We find that maternal political influence is associated with improved child health outcomes in models adjusting for maternal age, parental height and weight, level of schooling, household income, family size, and number of kin in the community. Children of politically influential women have higher weight-for-age (B = 0.33; 95\% CI = 0.12–0.54), height-for-age (B = 0.32; 95\% CI = 0.10–0.54), and weight-for-height (B = 0.24; 95\% CI = 0.04–0.44), and they are less likely to be diagnosed with common illnesses (OR = 0.48; 95\% CI = 0.31–0.76). These results are consistent with women leveraging their social status to enhance reproductive success through improvements in child health. We discuss these results in light of parental investment theory and the implications for the evolution of female social status in humans.},

	abstract = {Social rank is a significant determinant of fitness in a variety of species. The importance of social rank suggests that the process by which juveniles come to establish their position in the social hierarchy is a critical component of development. Here, we use the highly predictable process of rank acquisition in spotted hyenas to study the consequences of variation in rank acquisition in early life. In spotted hyenas, rank is ‘inherited’ through a learning process called ‘maternal rank inheritance.’ This pattern is very consistent: approximately 80\% of juveniles acquire the exact rank expected under the rules of maternal rank inheritance. The predictable nature of rank acquisition in these societies allows the process of rank acquisition to be studied independently from the ultimate rank that each juvenile attains. In this study, we use Elo-deviance scores, a novel application of the Elo-rating method, to calculate each juvenile's deviation from the expected pattern of maternal rank inheritance during development. Despite variability in rank acquisition among juveniles, most of these juveniles come to attain the exact rank expected of them according to the rules of maternal rank inheritance. Nevertheless, we find that transient variation in rank acquisition in early life is associated with long-term fitness consequences for these individuals: juveniles ‘underperforming’ their expected ranks show reduced survival and lower lifetime reproductive success than better-performing peers, and this relationship is independent of both maternal rank and rank achieved in adulthood. We also find that multiple sources of early life adversity have cumulative, but not compounding, effects on fitness. Future work is needed to determine if variation in rank acquisition directly affects fitness, or if some other variable, such as maternal investment or juvenile condition, causes variation in both of these outcomes.},

Here we used social network analysis to examine the relationship between sociality and summer survival, which is almost always attributable to predation. Yearling females had enhanced survival when they had stronger social relationships and were more central in their network. Adult female survival was not associated with social network traits, but females were more likely to survive the summer if they lived in larger groups. Survival of yearling and adult males was not associated with either social network trait variation or variation in group size. These findings identify a potential benefit for marmot sociality and an explanation for marmot colony social structuring.},

	abstract = {Infections can change social behaviour in multiple ways, with profound impacts on pathogen transmission. However, these impacts might depend on the type of behaviour, how sociality as a biological trait is defined (e.g. network degree vs. mean edge strength) and the type of social relationship between the interacting individuals. We used the highly social common vampire bat Desmodus rotundus to test how an immune challenge by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injections affects two different social behaviours and three alternate measures of sociality, and whether the LPS effect differs by kinship relationship. Effects of sickness should be lower for social behaviours that bestow greater benefits to inclusive fitness, such as food sharing. As predicted, immune-challenged bats experienced a greater reduction in allogrooming received than food sharing received. Sickness effects might also depend on how a social interaction is defined (e.g. the number of grooming partners vs. the duration of grooming events). We predicted that sickness would impact both the number and duration of social encounters, but we only detected a decrease in the number of grooming partners. Finally, sickness effects might vary with social relationship type. We predicted that sickness effects should be smaller for interactions among close kin. As expected, the immune challenge had smaller effects on mother–offspring interactions. In conclusion, our results highlight the need to explicitly consider how the effects of sickness on social network structure can differ depending on the ‘who, what, and how’ of social interactions, because these factors are likely to influence how sickness behaviour alters pathogen transmission.},

	abstract = {Aging, or senescence, is a progressive deterioration of physiological function with age. It leads to age-related declines in reproduction (reproductive senescence) and survival (actuarial senescence) in most organisms. However, senescence patterns can be highly variable across species, populations, and individuals, and the reasons for such variations remain poorly understood. Evolutionary theories predict that increases in reproductive effort in early life should be associated with accelerated senescence, but empirical tests have yielded mixed results. Although in sexually size-dimorphic species offspring of the larger sex (typically males) commonly require more parental resources, these sex differences are not currently incorporated into evolutionary theories of aging. Here, we show that female reproductive senescence varies with both the number and sex ratio of offspring weaned during early life, using data from a long-term study of bighorn sheep. For a given number of offspring, females that weaned more sons than daughters when aged between 2 and 7 y experienced faster senescence in offspring survival in old age. By contrast, analyses of actuarial senescence showed no cost of early-life reproduction. Our results unite two important topics in evolutionary biology: life history and sex allocation. Offspring sex ratio may help explain among-individual variation in senescence rates in other species, including humans.},

We used long-term data from wild yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer) living in two different elevational environments to quantify age-specific reproductive success of daughters born to mothers differing in age. Contrary to prediction, daughters born to older mothers had greater annual reproductive success on average than daughters born to younger mothers, and this translated into greater lifetime reproductive success. However, in the favorable lower elevation environment, daughters born to older mothers also had greater age-specific decreases in annual reproductive success. In the harsher higher elevation environment on the other hand, daughters born to older mothers tended to die before reaching ages at which such senescent decreases could be observed. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating environment-specific transgenerational parent age effects on adult offspring age-specific life-history traits to fully understand the substantial variation observed in senescence patterns in wild populations.},

But what type of action? Here we argue that restoration of primate habitat will be an essential component of strategies aimed at conserving primates and preventing the extinctions that may occur before the end of the century and propose that primates can act as flagship species for restoration efforts. To do this we gathered a team of academics from around the world with experience in restoration so that we could provide examples of why primate restoration ecology is needed, outline how primates can act as flagship species for restoration efforts of tropical forest, review what little is known about how primate populations respond to restoration efforts, and make specific recommendations of the next steps needed to make restoration of primate populations successful. We set four priorities: (1) academics must effectively communicate both the value of primates and the need for restoration; (2) more research is needed on how primates contribute to forest restoration; (3) more effort must be put into Masters and PhD level training for tropical country nationals; and finally (4) more emphasis is needed to monitor the responses of regenerating forest and primate populations where restoration efforts are initiated. We are optimistic that populations of many threatened species can recover, and extinctions can be prevented, but only if concerted large-scale efforts are made soon and if these efforts include primate habitat restoration.},

	abstract = {Predation is thought to have been a key selection pressure in primate evolution, especially in the savannah-woodland habitats where several early hominin species lived. However, predator-primate prey relationships are still poorly understood because human presence often deters predators, limiting our ability to quantify the impact of predation. Synchronized high-resolution tracking of leopards (Panthera pardus), vervets (Chlorocebus pygerythrus), and olive baboons (Papio anubis) during a 14-month study in Kenya revealed that increased vulnerability to leopard predation was not associated with higher encounter rates, smaller body size, smaller group size, or greater distance from refuges, contrary to long-standing inferences. Instead, the initiation, rate, timing, and duration of encounters, outcome of approaches, and predation events showed only a diel pattern of differential vulnerability. In the absence of human observers, vervets were more vulnerable during the day, whereas baboons were more vulnerable at night, but overall neither species was more vulnerable than the other. As our results show that leopards avoided baboons during the day and hunted them at night, we suggest that the same pattern would have applied to hominins—because they were even larger than baboons and bipedal, resulting in similarly offensive capability on the ground during the day but poorer agility in the trees at night, especially as they became committed bipeds. Drawing from hominid behavior and archaeopaleontological and ethnographic evidence, we hypothesize that ground-sleeping hominins initially dealt with this formidable threat by using stone tools to modify Acacia branches into ‘bomas’, thorny enclosures that provided nighttime shelter. The ability of hominins to create their own nightly refuges on the ground wherever Acacia spp. were available would have allowed them to range more widely, a crucial step in furthering the spread of hominins across Africa and beyond.},

Previous studies have shown that extra-pair mating decisions are linked to both individual traits and ecological factors. Here, we examine whether social associations among individuals prior to breeding also shape mating patterns, specifically the occurrence of EPP, in a small songbird, the blue tit. We test whether associations during the non-breeding period predict (1) future social pairs, (2) breeding proximity (i.e. the distance between breeding individuals) and (3) the likelihood that individuals have extra-pair young together. Individuals that were more strongly associated (those that foraged more often together) during winter tended to nest closer together. This, by itself, predicts EPP patterns, because most extra-pair sires are close neighbours. However, even after controlling for spatial effects, female–male dyads with stronger social associations prior to breeding were more likely to have extra-pair young. Our findings reveal a carry-over from social associations into future mating decisions. Quantifying the long-term social environment of individuals and studying its dynamics is a promising approach to enhance our understanding of the process of (extra-)pair formation.},

Although infanticide is likely adaptive for males, it imposes costs on females that are difficult to quantify without long-term demographic data. Here we investigate effects of AMRs and infanticide on female reproductive success and how these costs affect capuchin groups. We investigate (1) effects of AMR frequency on the production of surviving infants; (2) energetic and (3) temporal “opportunity costs” of infant loss; and (4) how AMR frequency impacts capuchin group sizes. Materials and methods We censused six groups (7–33 years/group, 74 adult females). We modeled surviving infant production in relation to AMR. We estimated a female's energy requirements for lost infants and the temporal cost relative to the median reproductive window. We simulated how varying AMR rates would affect future capuchin group sizes. Results Females exposed to more frequent AMR tended to produce fewer surviving offspring. We estimate the average lost infant requires approximately 33\% additional energy intake for its mother and represents 10\% of the average reproductive opportunity window available to females. Simulated populations remain viable at the observed rate of AMR occurrence but decrease in size at even slightly higher rates. Discussion While infanticide is adaptive for males, for females it affects lifetime reproductive success and imposes energetic and opportunity costs. Although capuchin populations have evolved with AMRs and infanticide, small increases in AMR frequency may lead to population decline/extinction. Infanticide likely plays a large role in population maintenance for capuchins.},

We evaluated the distribution of seasonal dietary shifts and migration across large-bodied mammalian herbivores and determined how these behaviors related to diet, body size, and environment. We found that herbivore strategies were consistently correlated with their traits: seasonal diet shifts were most prevalent among mixed feeding herbivores and migration among grazers and larger herbivores. Seasonality also played a role, particularly for migration, which was more common at higher latitudes. Both dietary shifts and migration were more widespread among extratropical herbivores, which also exhibited more intermediate diets and body sizes. Our findings suggest that strong seasonality in extratropical systems imposes pressure on herbivores, necessitating widespread behavioral responses to navigate seasonal resource bottlenecks. It follows that tropical and extratropical herbivores may have divergent responses to global change, with intensifying herbivore pressure in extratropical systems contrasting with diminishing herbivore pressure in tropical systems.},

	abstract = {Quantifying temporal patterns of ephemeral plant structures such as leaves, ﬂowers, and fruits gives insight into both plant and animal ecology. Different scales of temporal changes in fruits, for example within- versus across-year variability, are driven by different processes, but are not always easy to disentangle. We apply generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) to study a long-term fruit presence–absence data set of individual trees collected from a high-altitude Afromontane tropical rain forest site within Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP), Uganda. Our primary aim was to highlight and evaluate GAMM methodology, and quantify both intra- and interannual changes in fruit production. First, we conduct several simulation experiments to study the practical utility of model selection and smooth term estimation relevant for disentangling intra- and interannual variability. These simulations indicate that estimation of nonlinearity and seasonality is generally accurately identiﬁed using asymptotic theory. Applied to the empirical data set, we found that the forest-level fruiting variability arises from both regular seasonality and signiﬁcant interannual variability, with the years 2009–2010 in particular showing a signiﬁcant increase in the presence of fruits-driven by increased productivity of most species, and a regular annual peak associated occurring at the end of one of the two dry seasons. Our analyses illustrate a statistical framework for disentangling shortterm increases/decreases in fruiting effort while pinpointing speciﬁc times in which fruiting is atypical, providing a ﬁrst step for assessing the impacts of regular and irregular (e.g., climate change) abiotic covariates on fruiting phenology. Some consequences of the rich diversity of fruiting patterns observed here for the population biology of frugivores in BINP are also discussed.},

Characterizing temporal variation in forest productivity is thus critical for understanding adaptations of tropical forest frugivores, yet long-term phenology data from the tropics, in particular from African forests, are still scarce. Similarly, as the abiotic factors driving phenology in the tropics are predicted to change with a warming climate, studies documenting the relationship between climatic variables and fruit production are increasingly important. Here, we present data from 19 years of monitoring the phenology of 20 tree species at Ngogo in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Our aims were to characterize short- and long-term trends in productivity and to understand the abiotic factors driving temporal variability in fruit production. Short-term (month-to-month) variability in fruiting was relatively low at Ngogo, and overall fruit production increased significantly through the first half of the study. Among the abiotic variables, we expected to influence phenology patterns (including rainfall, solar irradiance, and average temperature), only average temperature was a significant predictor of monthly fruit production. We discuss these findings as they relate to the resource base of the frugivorous vertebrate community inhabiting Ngogo.},

We find that infanticide, although observed only rarely, is in fact a leading source of juvenile mortality. Infanticide accounted for 24\% of juvenile mortality, and one in 10 hyenas born in our population perished as a result of infanticide. In all observed cases of infanticide, killers were adult females, but victims could be of both sexes.

Studies of capuchin monkeys are particularly well situated to shed light on the selective pressures and genetic underpinnings of local adaptation to diverse habitats, longevity, and brain development. Distributed widely across Central and South America, they are inventive and extractive foragers, known for their sensorimotor intelligence. Capuchins have among the largest relative brain size of any monkey and a lifespan that exceeds 50 y, despite their small (3 to 5 kg) body size. We assemble and annotate a de novo reference genome for Cebus imitator. Through high-depth sequencing of DNA derived from blood, various tissues, and feces via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (fecalFACS) to isolate monkey epithelial cells, we compared genomes of capuchin populations from tropical dry forests and lowland rainforests and identified population divergence in genes involved in water balance, kidney function, and metabolism. Through a comparative genomics approach spanning a wide diversity of mammals, we identified genes under positive selection associated with longevity and brain development. Additionally, we provide a technological advancement in the use of noninvasive genomics for studies of free-ranging mammals. Our intra- and interspecific comparative study of capuchin genomics provides insights into processes underlying local adaptation to diverse and physiologically challenging environments, as well as the molecular basis of brain evolution and longevity.},

Researchers in ecology, evolution and behavior (EEB) often grapple with long-term, observational datasets from which they construct models to test causal hypotheses about biological processes. Similarly, epidemiologists analyse large, complex observational datasets to understand the distribution and determinants of human health. A key difference in the analytical workflows for these two distinct areas of biology is the delineation of data analysis tasks and explicit use of causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), widely adopted by epidemiologists. Here, we review the most recent causal inference literature and describe an analytical workflow that has direct applications for EEB. We start this commentary by defining four distinct analytical tasks (description, prediction, association, causal inference). The remainder of the text is dedicated to causal inference, specifically focusing on the use of DAGs to inform the modelling strategy. Given the increasing interest in causal inference and misperceptions regarding this task, we seek to facilitate an exchange of ideas between disciplinary silos and provide an analytical framework that is particularly relevant for making causal inference from observational data.},

Interactions between competition and resources are thought to dictate foraging strategies (e.g., specialization vs. generalization), but classical paradigms like optimal foraging and niche theory offer contrasting predictions for individual consumers. Further, both paradigms assume that individual foraging strategies maximize fitness, yet this prediction is rarely tested. We used repeated stable isotope measurements (δ13C, δ15N; N = 3,509) and six years of capture-mark-recapture data to quantify the relationship between environmental variation, individual foraging, and consumer fitness among four species of desert rodents. We tested the relative effects of intraspecific competition, interspecific competition, resource abundance, and resource diversity on the foraging strategies of 349 individual animals, and then quantified apparent survival as function of foraging strategies. Consistent with niche theory, individuals contracted their trophic niches and increased foraging specialization in response to both intraspecific and interspecific competition, but this effect was offset by resource availability and individuals generalized when plant biomass was high. Nevertheless, individual specialists obtained no apparent fitness benefit from trophic niche contractions as the most specialized individuals exhibited a 10\% reduction in monthly survival compared to the most generalized individuals. Ultimately, this resulted in annual survival probabilities nearly 4× higher for generalists compared to specialists. These results indicate that competition is the proximate driver of individual foraging strategies, and that diet-mediated fitness variation regulates population and community dynamics in stochastic resource environments. Further, our findings show dietary generalism is a fitness maximizing strategy, suggesting that plastic foraging strategies may play a key role in species’ ability to cope with environmental change.},

Large mammal herbivores in African tropical forests are major consumers of fruit, and many tree species rely on these consumers for dispersal of their seeds. Bush et al. monitored fruit production over three decades in a protected national park in Gabon, showing an 80\% decline across the 73 plant species monitored. At the same time, photographic records of forest elephants over the past decade indicate a substantial decline in body condition in these major herbivores. These results suggest that the capacity of the ecosystem to support the elephant population is decreasing, a worrying prospect in an environment that is still protected from other threats such as hunting and deforestation.
Science, this issue p. 1219
Afrotropical forests host much of the world’s remaining megafauna, although these animals are confined to areas where direct human influences are low. We used a rare long-term dataset of tree reproduction and a photographic database of forest elephants to assess food availability and body condition of an emblematic megafauna species at Lopé National Park, Gabon. Our analysis reveals an 81\% decline in fruiting over a 32-year period (1986–2018) and an 11\% decline in body condition of fruit-dependent forest elephants from 2008 to 2018. Fruit famine in one of the last strongholds for African forest elephants should raise concern about the ability of this species and other fruit-dependent megafauna to persist in the long term, with potential consequences for broader ecosystem and biosphere functioning.
Plant reproduction has slowed and forest elephant body condition has declined over recent decades in a forest reserve in Gabon.

	abstract = {Until around 2000, giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis were believed to have no social structure. Despite a resurgence of interest in giraffe behaviour in around 2010, most studies are of isolated populations, making it difficult to draw general conclusions. Although it is now well established that giraffe social organisation is non-random, there is little consensus as to what influences preferred and avoided associations or the underpinning mechanisms. We test two hypotheses: first, giraffe have a complex cooperative social system, exhibited by 1) stable groups of females, 2) offspring that stay in their natal group for part or all of their lives, 3) support by non-mothers in rearing young, and 4) non-reproductive females in the group; and second, giraffe form matrilineal societies, evidenced by 1) male dispersal, 2) female philopatry, 3) assistance in raising or protecting offspring, and 4) individual benefits gained from social foraging. We reviewed 404 papers on giraffe behaviour and social organisation; captive studies were included where they supplemented information from free-living populations. We show that giraffe exhibit many of the features typical of mammals with complex cooperative social systems and matrilineal societies. However, the social complexity hypothesis posits that such species also require complex communication systems to regulate interactions and relations among group members; giraffe communication systems are poorly understood. Quantifying the fitness and survival benefits of the giraffe’s social organisation is necessary to ensure its long-term survival. Giraffe numbers have declined by 40\% since 1985, they have been declared extinct in seven (possibly nine) countries and are listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. We identify research areas that will advance our understanding of giraffe behaviour and conservation requirements.},

	abstract = {A lifetime of change
Measurements of total and basal energy in a large cohort of subjects at ages spanning from before birth to old age document distinct changes that occur during a human lifetime. Pontzer et al. report that energy expenditure (adjusted for weight) in neonates was like that of adults but increased substantially in the first year of life (see the Perspective by Rhoads and Anderson). It then gradually declined until young individuals reached adult characteristics, which were maintained from age 20 to 60 years. Older individuals showed reduced energy expenditure. Tissue metabolism thus appears not to be constant but rather to undergo transitions at critical junctures.
Science, abe5017, this issue p. 808; see also abl4537, p. 738
Total daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, but its trajectory over the life course is poorly studied. We analyzed a large, diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 years. Total expenditure increased with fat-free mass in a power-law manner, with four distinct life stages. Fat-free mass–adjusted expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates to {\textasciitilde}50\% above adult values at {\textasciitilde}1 year; declines slowly to adult levels by {\textasciitilde}20 years; remains stable in adulthood (20 to 60 years), even during pregnancy; then declines in older adults. These changes shed light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the life span.
A study analyzes how metabolism and energy expenditure change over the human life span.

	abstract = {The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, with low precipitation, low oxygen partial pressure, and temperatures routinely dropping below −30 °C in winter, presents several physiological challenges to its fauna. Yet it is home to many endemic mammalian species, including the plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae). How these small animals that are incapable of hibernation survive the winter is an enigma. Measurements of daily energy expenditure (DEE) using the doubly labeled water method show that pikas suppress their DEE during winter. At the same body weight, pikas in winter expend 29.7\% less than in summer, despite ambient temperatures being approximately 25 °C lower. Combined with resting metabolic rates (RMRs), this gives them an exceptionally low metabolic scope in winter (DEE/RMRt = 1.60 ± 0.30; RMRt is resting metabolic rate at thermoneutrality). Using implanted body temperature loggers and filming in the wild, we show that this is achieved by reducing body temperature and physical activity. Thyroid hormone (T3 and T4) measurements indicate this metabolic suppression is probably mediated via the thyroid axis. Winter activity was lower at sites where domestic yak (Bos grunniens) densities were higher. Pikas supplement their food intake at these sites by eating yak feces, demonstrated by direct observation, identification of yak DNA in pika stomach contents, and greater convergence in the yak/pika microbiotas in winter. This interspecific coprophagy allows pikas to thrive where yak are abundant and partially explains why pika densities are higher where domestic yak, their supposed direct competitors for food, are more abundant.},

	abstract = {The ability of dispersing individuals to adjust their behaviour to changing conditions is instrumental in overcoming challenges and reducing dispersal costs, consequently increasing overall dispersal success. Understanding how dispersers' behaviour and physiology change during the dispersal process, and how they differ from resident individuals, can shed light on the mechanisms by which dispersers increase survival and maximise reproduction. By analysing individual behaviour and concentrations of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCM), a stress-associated biomarker, we sought to identify the proximate causes behind differences in survival and reproduction between dispersing and resident meerkats Suricata suricatta. We used data collected on 67 dispersing and 108 resident females to investigate (a) which individual, social and environmental factors are correlated to foraging and vigilance, and whether the role of such factors differs among dispersal phases, and between dispersers and residents; (b) how time allocated to either foraging or vigilance correlated to survival in dispersers and residents and (c) the link between aggression and change in fGCM concentration, and their relationship with reproductive rates in dispersing groups and resident groups with either long-established or newly established dominant females. Time allocated to foraging increased across dispersal phases, whereas time allocated to vigilance decreased. Time allocated to foraging and vigilance correlated positively and negatively, respectively, with dispersers' group size. We did not find a group size effect for residents. High proportions of time allocated to foraging correlated with high survival, and more so in dispersers, suggesting that maintaining good physical condition may reduce mortality during dispersal. Furthermore, while subordinate individuals rarely reproduced in resident groups, the conception rate of subordinates in newly formed dispersing groups was equal to that of their dominant individuals. Mirroring conception rates, in resident groups, fGCM concentrations were lower in subordinates than in dominants, whereas in disperser groups, fGCM concentrations did not differ between subordinates and dominants. Our results, which highlight the relationship between behavioural and physiological factors and demographic rates, provide insights into some of the mechanisms that individuals of a cooperative species can use to increase overall dispersal success.},

Such compromises have energetic repercussions, yet research in collective behaviour has largely neglected locomotor consensus costs. Here, we integrate high-resolution tracking of wild baboon locomotion and movement with simulations to demonstrate that size-based variation in locomotor capacity poses an obstacle to the collective movement. While all baboons modulate their gait and move-pause dynamics during collective movement, the costs of maintaining cohesion are disproportionately borne by smaller group members. Although consensus costs are not distributed equally, all group-mates do make locomotor compromises, suggesting a shared decision-making process drives the pace of collective movement in this highly despotic species. These results highlight the importance of considering how social dynamics and locomotor capacity interact to shape the movement ecology of group-living species.},

	abstract = {Recent progress in positioning technology facilitates the collection of massive amounts of sequential spatial data on animals. This has led to new opportunities and challenges when investigating animal movement behaviour and habitat selection. Tools like Step Selection Functions (SSFs) are relatively new powerful models for studying resource selection by animals moving through the landscape. SSFs compare environmental attributes of observed steps (the linear segment between two consecutive observations of position) with alternative random steps taken from the same starting point. SSFs have been used to study habitat selection, human-wildlife interactions, movement corridors, and dispersal behaviours in animals. SSFs also have the potential to depict resource selection at multiple spatial and temporal scales. There are several aspects of SSFs where consensus has not yet been reached such as how to analyse the data, when to consider habitat covariates along linear paths between observations rather than at their endpoints, how many random steps should be considered to measure availability, and how to account for individual variation. In this review we aim to address all these issues, as well as to highlight weak features of this modelling approach that should be developed by further research. Finally, we suggest that SSFs could be integrated with state-space models to classify behavioural states when estimating SSFs.},

	abstract = {A resource selection function is a model of the likelihood that an available spatial unit will be used by an animal, given its resource value. But how do we appropriately define availability? Step selection analysis deals with this problem at the scale of the observed positional data, by matching each ‘used step’ (connecting two consecutive observed positions of the animal) with a set of ‘available steps’ randomly sampled from a distribution of observed steps or their characteristics. Here we present a simple extension to this approach, termed integrated step selection analysis (iSSA), which relaxes the implicit assumption that observed movement attributes (i.e. velocities and their temporal autocorrelations) are independent of resource selection. Instead, iSSA relies on simultaneously estimating movement and resource selection parameters, thus allowing simple likelihood-based inference of resource selection within a mechanistic movement model. We provide theoretical underpinning of iSSA, as well as practical guidelines to its implementation. Using computer simulations, we evaluate the inferential and predictive capacity of iSSA compared to currently used methods. Our work demonstrates the utility of iSSA as a general, flexible and user-friendly approach for both evaluating a variety of ecological hypotheses, and predicting future ecological patterns.},

	abstract = {Theoretical and empirical research has shown that increased variability in demographic rates often results in a decline in the population growth rate. In order to reduce the adverse effects of increased variability, life-history theory predicts that demographic rates that contribute disproportionately to population growth should be buffered against environmental variation. To date, evidence of demographic buffering is still equivocal and limited to analyses on a reduced number of age classes (e.g. juveniles and adults), and on single sex models. Here we used Bayesian inference models for age-specific survival and fecundity on a long-term dataset of wild mountain gorillas. We used these estimates to parameterize two-sex, age-specific stochastic population projection models that accounted for the yearly covariation between demographic rates. We estimated the sensitivity of the long-run stochastic population growth rate to reductions in survival and fecundity on ages belonging to nine sex-age classes for survival and three age classes for female fecundity. We found a statistically significant negative linear relationship between the sensitivities and variances of demographic rates, with strong demographic buffering on young adult female survival and low buffering on older female and silverback survival and female fecundity. We found moderate buffering on all immature stages and on prime-age females. Previous research on long-lived slow species has found high buffering of prime-age female survival and low buffering on immature survival and fecundity. Our results suggest that the moderate buffering of the immature stages can be partially due to the mountain gorilla social system and the relative stability of their environment. Our results provide clear support for the demographic buffering hypothesis and its predicted effects on species at the slow end of the slow–fast life-history continuum, but with the surprising outcome of moderate social buffering on the survival of immature stages. We also demonstrate how increasing the number of sex-age classes can greatly improve the detection of demographic buffering in wild populations.},

Recent research has identified a near-linear relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions, and the resulting regional and seasonal temperature increase. Here, we use this relationship to assess the potential impact that cumulative CO2 emissions could have on the ranges available to primate species. We used data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature on ranges for 426 species and subspecies of non-human primates, combined with spatial climate data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 that represent regional and seasonal temperature changes per unit CO2 emissions. Using these data, we estimated the portion of the area of each species’ range where annual average temperatures exceed the Pre-industrial Seasonal Maximum Temperatures (PSMT), for cumulative CO2 emissions from 600 to 2000 billion tonnes of carbon. For the level of emissions corresponding to a 2 °C global temperature increase scenario, 26.1\% of all ranges had temperatures in excess of their PSMTs, and for 8\% of species, the entire current range was above their PSMT. This suggests the potential for considerable loss of or compromised habitat for non-human primates on a global scale, as a result of the emergence of climate conditions that are outside of the scope of historical experience for many species. Our results point to key priorities for conservation efforts, as well as the need for future research on strategies to increase the resilience of vulnerable local non-human primate populations.},

	abstract = {Understanding the neutral, biological, and environmental processes driving species distributions is valuable in informing conservation efforts because it will help us predict how species will respond to changes in environmental conditions. Environmental processes affect species differently according to their biological traits, which determine how they interact with their environment. Therefore, functional, trait-based modeling approaches are considered important for predicting distributions and species responses to change but even for data-rich primate communities our understanding of the relationships between traits and environmental conditions is limited. Here we use a large-scale, high-resolution data set of African diurnal primate distributions, biological traits, and environmental conditions to investigate the role of biological traits and environmental trait filtering in primate distributions. We collected data from published sources for 354 sites and 14 genera with 57 species across sub-Saharan Africa. We then combined a three-table ordination method, RLQ, with the fourth-corner approach to test relationships between environmental variables and biological traits and used a mapping approach to visually assess patterning in primate genus and species’ distributions. We found no significant relationships between any groups of environmental variables and biological traits, despite a clear role of environmental filtering in driving genus and species’ distributions. The most important environmental driver of species distributions was temperature seasonality, followed by rainfall. We conclude that the relative flexibility of many primate genera means that not any one particular set of traits drives their species–environment associations, despite the clear role of such associations in their distribution patterns.},

	abstract = {Approximately 25\% of mammals are currently threatened with extinction, a risk that is amplified under climate change. Species persistence under climate change is determined by the combined effects of climatic factors on multiple demographic rates (survival, development and reproduction), and hence, population dynamics. Thus, to quantify which species and regions on Earth are most vulnerable to climate-driven extinction, a global understanding of how different demographic rates respond to climate is urgently needed. Here, we perform a systematic review of literature on demographic responses to climate, focusing on terrestrial mammals, for which extensive demographic data are available. To assess the full spectrum of responses, we synthesize information from studies that quantitatively link climate to multiple demographic rates. We find only 106 such studies, corresponding to 87 mammal species. These 87 species constitute {\textless}1\% of all terrestrial mammals. Our synthesis reveals a strong mismatch between the locations of demographic studies and the regions and taxa currently recognized as most vulnerable to climate change. Surprisingly, for most mammals and regions sensitive to climate change, holistic demographic responses to climate remain unknown. At the same time, we reveal that filling this knowledge gap is critical as the effects of climate change will operate via complex demographic mechanisms: a vast majority of mammal populations display projected increases in some demographic rates but declines in others, often depending on the specific environmental context, complicating simple projections of population fates. Assessments of population viability under climate change are in critical need to gather data that account for multiple demographic responses, and coordinated actions to assess demography holistically should be prioritized for mammals and other taxa.},

However, the relationship between group size and individual fitness has been difficult to establish for long-lived species where the number of groups studied is typically quite low. Here, we present evidence for optimal group size that maximizes female fitness in a population of geladas (Theropithecus gelada). Drawing on 14 years of demographic data, we found that females in small groups experienced the highest death rates, while females in mid-sized groups exhibited the highest reproductive performance. This group size effect on female reproductive performance was largely explained by variation in infant mortality (and, in particular, by infanticide from immigrant males) but not by variation in reproductive rates. Taken together, females in mid-sized groups are projected to attain optimal fitness due to conspecific infanticide and, potentially, predation. Our findings provide insight into how and why group size shapes fitness in long-lived species.},

	abstract = {Social structure is a fundamental aspect of animal populations. In order to understand the function and evolution of animal societies, it is important to quantify how individual attributes, such as age and sex, shape social relationships. Detecting these influences in wild populations under natural conditions can be challenging, especially when social interactions are difficult to observe and broad-scale measures of association are used as a proxy. In this study, we use unoccupied aerial systems to observe association, synchronous surfacing, and physical contact within a pod of southern resident killer whales (Orcinus orca). We show that interactions do not occur randomly between associated individuals, and that interaction types are not interchangeable. While age and sex did not detectably influence association network structure, both interaction networks showed significant social homophily by age and sex, and centrality within the contact network was higher among females and young individuals. These results suggest killer whales exhibit interesting parallels in social bond formation and social life histories with primates and other terrestrial social mammals, and demonstrate how important patterns can be missed when using associations as a proxy for interactions in animal social network studies.},

Previous studies have shown that social organisms frequently benefit from pooling imperfect individual estimates. However, in principle, collective intelligence may also emerge from interactions between individuals, rather than from the enhancement of personal estimates. Here, we reveal that this emergent problem solving is the predominant mechanism by which a mobile animal group responds to complex environmental gradients. Robust collective sensing arises at the group level from individuals modulating their speed in response to local, scalar, measurements of light and through social interaction with others. This distributed sensing requires only rudimentary cognition and thus could be widespread across biological taxa, in addition to being appropriate and cost-effective for robotic agents.
Living in a group amplifies the reach of an individual's capacity to sense environmental changes.

The model is then used to show how differences among individuals influence group structure, and how individuals employing simple, local rules of thumb, can accurately change their spatial position within a group (e.g. to move to the centre, the front, or the periphery) in the absence of information on their current position within the group as a whole.

We use these methods to investigate how populations evolve within unpredictable, time-varying resource environments. We show that populations evolve toward a distinctive regime in behavioral phenotype space, where small responses of individuals to local environmental cues cause spontaneous changes in the collective state of groups. These changes resemble phase transitions in physical systems. Through these transitions, individuals evolve the emergent capacity to sense and respond to resource gradients (i.e. individuals perceive gradients via social interactions, rather than sensing gradients directly), and to allocate themselves among distinct, distant resource patches. Our results yield new insight into how natural selection, acting on selfish individuals, results in the highly effective collective responses evident in nature.},

Interpretation of the parameters in the multi-state model and the impact of different sampling schemes for the random locations are discussed. We prove the relationship between the new model, called HMM-SSF, and a random walk model on the plane. This relationship allows one to use both movement characteristics and local discrete choice behaviors when identifying the model’s hidden states. The new HMM-SSF is used to model the movement behavior of GPS-collared bison in Prince Albert National Park, Canada, where it successfully teases apart areas used to forage and to travel. The analysis thus provides valuable insights into how bison adjust their movement to habitat features, thereby revealing spatial determinants of functional connectivity in heterogeneous landscapes.},

A previously unexplored social influence – baboons’ preference for locations that other troop members have recently traversed – is the most important predictor of individual movement decisions. Habitat is shown to influence movement over multiple spatial scales, from long-range attraction and repulsion from the troop’s sleeping site, to relatively local influences including road-following and a short-range avoidance of dense vegetation. Scaling to the collective level reveals a clear association between habitat features and the emergent structure of the group, highlighting the importance of habitat heterogeneity in shaping group coordination.},

	abstract = {The spontaneous emergence of pattern formation is ubiquitous in nature, often arising as a collective phenomenon from interactions among a large number of individual constituents or sub-systems. Understanding, and controlling, collective behavior is dependent on determining the low-level dynamical principles from which spatial and temporal patterns emerge; a key question is whether different group-level patterns result from all components of a system responding to the same external factor, individual components changing behavior but in a distributed self-organized way, or whether multiple collective states co-exist for the same individual behaviors. Using schooling fish (golden shiners, in groups of 30 to 300 fish) as a model system, we demonstrate that collective motion can be effectively mapped onto a set of order parameters describing the macroscopic group structure, revealing the existence of at least three dynamically-stable collective states; swarm, milling and polarized groups. Swarms are characterized by slow individual motion and a relatively dense, disordered structure. Increasing swim speed is associated with a transition to one of two locally-ordered states, milling or highly-mobile polarized groups. The stability of the discrete collective behaviors exhibited by a group depends on the number of group members. Transitions between states are influenced by both external (boundary-driven) and internal (changing motion of group members) factors. Whereas transitions between locally-disordered and locally-ordered group states are speed dependent, analysis of local and global properties of groups suggests that, congruent with theory, milling and polarized states co-exist in a bistable regime with transitions largely driven by perturbations. Our study allows us to relate theoretical and empirical understanding of animal group behavior and emphasizes dynamic changes in the structure of such groups.},

	abstract = {Collective foraging, based on positive feedback and quorum responses, is believed to improve the foraging efficiency of animals. Nutritional models suggest that social information transfer increases the ability of foragers with closely aligned nutritional needs to find nutrients and maintain a balanced diet. However, whether or not collective foraging is adaptive in a heterogeneous group composed of individuals with differing nutritional needs is virtually unexplored. Here we develop an evolutionary agent-based model using concepts of nutritional ecology to address this knowledge gap. Our aim was to evaluate how collective foraging, mediated by social retention on foods, can improve nutrient balancing in individuals with different requirements. The model suggests that in groups where inter-individual nutritional needs are unimodally distributed, high levels of collective foraging yield optimal individual fitness by reducing search times that result from moving between nutritionally imbalanced foods. However, where nutritional needs are highly bimodal (e.g. where the requirements of males and females differ) collective foraging is selected against, leading to group fission. In this case, additional mechanisms such as assortative interactions can coevolve to allow collective foraging by subgroups of individuals with aligned requirements. Our findings indicate that collective foraging is an efficient strategy for nutrient regulation in animals inhabiting complex nutritional environments and exhibiting a range of social forms.},

              Nonhuman primates host a plethora of potentially zoonotic microbes, with simian retroviruses receiving heightened attention due to their roles in the origins of human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2. However, incomplete taxonomic and geographic sampling of potential hosts, especially the African colobines, has left the full range of primate retrovirus diversity unexplored. Blood samples collected from 31 wild-living red colobus monkeys (
              Procolobus

              Piliocolobus

              rufomitratus tephrosceles
              ) from Kibale National Park, Uganda, were tested for antibodies to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), simian T-cell lymphotrophic virus (STLV), and simian foamy virus (SFV) and for nucleic acids of these same viruses using genus-specific PCRs. Of 31 red colobus tested, 22.6\% were seroreactive to SIV, 6.4\% were seroreactive to STLV, and 97\% were seroreactive to SFV. Phylogenetic analyses of SIV polymerase (
              pol
              ), STLV

              and long terminal repeat (LTR), and SFV
              pol
              and LTR sequences revealed unique SIV and SFV strains and a novel STLV lineage, each divergent from corresponding retroviral lineages previously described in Western red colobus (
              Procolobus badius badius
              ) or black-and-white colobus (
              Colobus guereza
              ). Phylogenetic analyses of host mitochondrial DNA sequences revealed that red colobus populations in East and West Africa diverged from one another approximately 4.25 million years ago. These results indicate that geographic subdivisions within the red colobus taxonomic complex exert a strong influence on retroviral phylogeny and that studying retroviral diversity in closely related primate taxa should be particularly informative for understanding host-virus coevolution.},

	abstract = {Nutrition impinges on virtually all aspects of an animal's life, including social interactions. Recent advances in nutritional ecology show how social animals often trade-off individual nutrition and group cohesion when foraging in simplified experimental environments. Here, we explore how the spatial structure of the nutritional landscape influences these complex collective foraging dynamics in ecologically realistic environments. We introduce an individual-based model integrating key concepts of nutritional geometry, collective animal behaviour and spatial ecology to study the nutritional behaviour of animal groups in large heterogeneous environments containing foods with different abundance, patchiness and nutritional composition. Simulations show that the spatial distribution of foods constrains the ability of individuals to balance their nutrient intake, the lowest performance being attained in environments with small isolated patches of nutritionally complementary foods. Social interactions improve individual regulatory performances when food is scarce and clumpy, but not when it is abundant and scattered, suggesting that collective foraging is favoured in some environments only. These social effects are further amplified if foragers adopt flexible search strategies based on their individual nutritional state. Our model provides a conceptual and predictive framework for developing new empirically testable hypotheses in the emerging field of social nutrition.This article is part of the themed issue ‘Physiological determinants of social behaviour in animals’.},

The model requires no explicit signaling or identification of informed individuals; individuals merely adjust their steering in response to socially acquired information on relative motion of neighbors. In this paper, we show how the dynamics of this system can be modeled analytically, and we derive a testable result that adding uninformed individuals improves stability of collective decision making. We first present a continuous-time dynamic model and prove a necessary and sufficient condition for stable convergence to a collective decision in this model. The stability of the decision, which corresponds to most of the group moving in one of two alternative preferred directions, depends explicitly on the magnitude of the difference in preferred directions; for a difference above a threshold the decision is stable and below that same threshold the decision is unstable. Given qualitative agreement with the results of the previous simulation study, we proceed to explore analytically the subtle but important role of the uninformed individuals in the continuous-time model. Significantly, we show that the likelihood of a collective decision increases with increasing numbers of uninformed individuals.},

	abstract = {One of the common goals of time series analysis is to use the observed series to inform predictions for future observations. In the absence of any actual new data to predict, cross-validation can be used to estimate a model's future predictive accuracy, for instance, for the purpose of model comparison or selection. Exact cross-validation for Bayesian models is often computationally expensive, but approximate cross-validation methods have been developed, most notably methods for leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV). If the actual prediction task is to predict the future given the past, LOO-CV provides an overly optimistic estimate because the information from future observations is available to influence predictions of the past. To properly account for the time series structure, we can use leave-future-out cross-validation (LFO-CV). Like exact LOO-CV, exact LFO-CV requires refitting the model many times to different subsets of the data. Using Pareto smoothed importance sampling, we propose a method for approximating exact LFO-CV that drastically reduces the computational costs while also providing informative diagnostics about the quality of the approximation.},

	abstract = {Changes in the life cycle of organisms (i.e. phenology) are one of the most widely used early-warning indicators of climate change, yet this remains poorly understood throughout the tropics. We exhaustively reviewed any published and unpublished study on fruiting phenology carried out at the community level in the American tropics and subtropics (latitudinal range: 26°N–26°S) to (1) provide a comprehensive overview of the current status of fruiting phenology research throughout the Neotropics; (2) unravel the climatic factors that have been widely reported as drivers of fruiting phenology; and (3) provide a preliminary assessment of the potential phenological responses of plants under future climatic scenarios. Despite the large number of phenological datasets uncovered (218), our review shows that their geographic distribution is very uneven and insufficient for the large surface of the Neotropics ({\textasciitilde}1 dataset per {\textasciitilde}78,000km2). Phenological research is concentrated in few areas with many studies (state of São Paulo, Brazil, and Costa Rica), whereas vast regions elsewhere are entirely unstudied. Sampling effort in fruiting phenology studies was generally low: the majority of datasets targeted fewer than 100 plant species (71\%), lasted 2years or less (72\%), and only 10.4\% monitored {\textgreater}15 individuals per species. We uncovered only 10 sites with ten or more years of phenological monitoring. The ratio of numbers of species sampled to overall estimates of plant species richness was wholly insufficient for highly diverse vegetation types such as tropical rainforest, seasonal forest and cerrado, and only slightly more robust for less diverse vegetation types, such as deserts, arid shrublands and open grassy savannas. Most plausible drivers of phenology extracted from these datasets were environmental (78.5\%), whereas biotic drivers were rare (6\%). Among climatic factors, rainfall was explicitly included in 73.4\% of cases, followed by air temperature (19.3\%). Other environmental cues such as water level (6\%), solar radiation or photoperiod (3.2\%), and ENSO events (1.4\%) were rarely addressed. In addition, drivers were analyzed statistically in only 38\% of datasets and techniques were basically correlative, with only 4.8\% of studies including any consideration of the inherently autocorrelated character of phenological time series. Fruiting peaks were significantly more often reported during the rainy season both in rainforests and cerrado woodlands, which is at odds with the relatively aseasonal character of the former vegetation type. Given that climatic models predict harsh future conditions for the tropics, we urgently need to determine the magnitude of changes in plant reproductive phenology and distinguish those from cyclical oscillations. Long-term monitoring and herbarium data are therefore key for detecting these trends. Our review shows that the unevenness in geographic distribution of studies, and diversity of sampling methods, vegetation types, and research motivation hinder the emergence of clear general phenological patterns and drivers for the Neotropics. We therefore call for prioritizing research in unexplored areas, and improving the quantitative component and statistical design of reproductive phenology studies to enhance our predictions of climate change impacts on tropical plants and animals.},

We document a powerful link between GCs and survival: Females with relatively high current GCs or high lifelong cumulative GCs face an elevated risk of death. A hypothetical female who maintained GCs in the top 90\% for her age across adulthood would be expected to lose 5.4 years of life relative to a female who maintained GCs in the bottom 10\% for her age. Hence, differences among individuals in HPA axis activity provide valuable prognostic information about disparities in life span.},

	abstract = {Many ecological systems are now exposed to multiple stressors, and ecosystem management increasingly requires consideration of the joint effects of multiple stressors on focal populations, communities and ecosystems. In the absence of empirical data, ecosystem managers could use null models based on the combination of independently acting stressors to estimate the joint effects of multiple stressors. Here, we used a simulation study and a meta-analysis to explore the consequences of null model selection for the prediction of mortality resulting from exposure to two stressors. Comparing five existing null models, we show that some null models systematically predict lower mortality rates than others, with predicted mortality rates up to 67.5\% higher or 50\% lower than the commonly used Simple Addition model. However, the null model predicting the highest mortality rate differed across parameter sets, and therefore there is no general ‘precautionary null model’ for multiple stressors. Using a multi-model framework, we re-analysed data from two earlier meta-analyses and found that 54\% of the observed joint effects fell within the range of predictions from the suite of null models. Furthermore, we found that most null models systematically underestimated the observed joint effects, with only the Stressor Addition model showing a bias for overestimation. Finally, we found that the intensity of individual stressors was the strongest predictor of the magnitude of the joint effect across all null models. As a result, studies characterizing the effects of individuals stressors are still required for accurate prediction of mortality resulting from multiple stressors.},

	abstract = {We examined the effects of extreme seasonality on the activity budget and diet of wild chacma baboons with access to a high-quality, human-derived food source. The Cape Peninsula of South Africa is unusual among nonhuman primate habitats due to its seasonal extremes in day length and climate. Winter days are markedly shorter and colder than summer days but have higher rainfall and higher primary production of annually flowering plants. This combination of fewer daylight hours but higher rainfall is substantially different from the ecological constraints faced by both equatorial baboon populations and those living in temperate climates with summer rainfall. We sought to understand how these seasonal differences affect time budgets of food-enhanced troops in comparison to both other food-enhanced troops and wild foraging troops at similar latitudes. Our results revealed significant seasonal differences in activity budget and diet, a finding that contrasts with other baboon populations with access to high-return anthropogenic foods. Similar to nonprovisioned troops at similar latitudes, troop members spent more time feeding, socializing, and traveling during the long summer days compared to the short winter days, and proportionately more time feeding and less time resting in summer compared to winter. Summer diets consisted mainly of fynbos and nonindigenous foods, whereas winter diets were dominated by annually flowering plants (mainly grasses) and ostrich pellets raided from a nearby ostrich farm. In this case, food enhancement may have effectively exaggerated seasonal differences in activity budgets by providing access to a high-return food (ostrich pellets) that was spatially and temporally coincident with abundant winter fallback foods (grasses). The frequent use of both alien vegetation and high-return, human-derived foods highlights the dietary flexibility of baboons as a key element of their overall success in rapidly transforming environments such as the South African Cape Peninsula.

	abstract = {The Hawaiian Islands are an ideal location to study the response of tropical forests to climate variability because of their extreme isolation in the middle of the Pacific, which makes them especially sensitive to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Most research examining the response of tropical forests to drought or El Niño have focused on rainforests, however, tropical dry forests cover a large area of the tropics and may respond very differently than rainforests. We use satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from February 2000-February 2009 to show that rainforests and dry forests in the Hawaiian Islands exhibit asynchronous responses in leaf phenology to seasonal and El Niño-driven drought. Dry forest NDVI was more tightly coupled with precipitation compared to rainforest NDVI. Rainforest cloud frequency was negatively correlated with the degree of asynchronicity (ΔNDVI) between forest types, most strongly at a 1-month lag. Rainforest green-up and dry forest brown-down was particularly apparent during the 2002–003 El Niño. The spatial pattern of NDVI response to the NINO 3.4 Sea Surface Temperature (SST) index during 2002–2003 showed that the leeward side exhibited significant negative correlations to increased SSTs, whereas the windward side exhibited significant positive correlations to increased SSTs, most evident at an 8 to 9-month lag. This study demonstrates that different tropical forest types exhibit asynchronous responses to seasonal and El Niño-driven drought, and suggests that mechanisms controlling dry forest leaf phenology are related to water-limitation, whereas rainforests are more light-limited.},

Behavioral flexibility allows animals to rapidly cope with changing environmental conditions, and behavior represents an important component of a species’ adaptive capacity in the face of climate change. However, there is currently a lack of knowledge about the limits or constraints on behavioral responses to changing conditions. Here, we characterize the contexts in which organisms respond to climate variability through behavior. First, we quantify patterns in behavioral responses across taxa with respect to timescales, climatic stimuli, life-history traits, and ecology. Next, we identify existing knowledge gaps, research biases, and other challenges. Finally, we discuss how conservation practitioners and resource managers can incorporate an improved understanding of behavioral flexibility into natural resource management and policy decisions.},

We found that climate change is projected to negatively impact all assessed areas, but endemic species are consistently more adversely impacted. Terrestrial endemics are projected to be 2.7 and 10 times more impacted than non-endemic natives and introduced species respectively, the latter being overall unaffected by climate change. We defined a high risk of extinction as a loss of {\textgreater}80\% due to climate change alone. Of endemic species, 34\% and 46\% in terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and 100\% and 84\% of island and mountain species were projected to face high extinction risk respectively. A doubling of warming is projected to disproportionately increase extinction risks for endemic and non-endemic native species. Thus, reducing extinction risks requires both adaptation responses in biodiversity rich-spots and enhanced climate change mitigation.},

The aim of the present study is to compare phenological sensitivities to temperature of seven woody species between each other and within-species between two geographical areas using both altitudinal and temporal gradients (Abies alba, Acer pseudoplatanus, Carpinus betulus, Fagus sylvatica, Fraxinus excelsior, Ilex aquifolium and Quercus petraea). The timing of leaf unfolding was monitored (i) over 2 years along two altitudinal gradients in the Pyrénées mountains (six species), and (ii) over 22 years in Fontainebleau forest (four species). Three species were present in both areas which allowed us to compare their phenological sensitivity to temperature over altitudinal and temporal gradients. Along altitudinal gradients, we observed for all species an advance in leaf unfolding with decreasing elevation, ranging from 11 to 34 days 1000m−1 for beech and oak, respectively. Across the temporal gradient, we found significant advances in leaf unfolding for oak (−0.42daysyear−1) and ash (−0.78daysyear−1) since 1976, whereas no significant advance was observed for beech and hornbeam. For both gradients and for all species, significant correlations were found between leaf unfolding dates and temperature, except for beech in the temporal study. Moreover, we highlighted that phenological sensitivity to temperature was very similar between the two geographically separated populations (Pyrénées and Fontainebleau forests). Thus, oak had the strongest sensitivity (−7.48 and −7.26days°C−1 in altitudinal and temporal gradient, respectively) and beech had the lowest (−2.09 and −2.03days°C−1). Our results suggest that population sensitivity to global warming might be stable for a given species, in spite of its possible local adaptation.},

	abstract = {Animal acoustic communication often takes the form of complex sequences, made up of multiple distinct acoustic units. Apart from the well-known example of birdsong, other animals such as insects, amphibians, and mammals (including bats, rodents, primates, and cetaceans) also generate complex acoustic sequences. Occasionally, such as with birdsong, the adaptive role of these sequences seems clear (e.g. mate attraction and territorial defence). More often however, researchers have only begun to characterise – let alone understand – the significance and meaning of acoustic sequences. Hypotheses abound, but there is little agreement as to how sequences should be defined and analysed. Our review aims to outline suitable methods for testing these hypotheses, and to describe the major limitations to our current and near-future knowledge on questions of acoustic sequences. This review and prospectus is the result of a collaborative effort between 43 scientists from the fields of animal behaviour, ecology and evolution, signal processing, machine learning, quantitative linguistics, and information theory, who gathered for a 2013 workshop entitled, ‘Analysing vocal sequences in animals’. Our goal is to present not just a review of the state of the art, but to propose a methodological framework that summarises what we suggest are the best practices for research in this field, across taxa and across disciplines. We also provide a tutorial-style introduction to some of the most promising algorithmic approaches for analysing sequences. We divide our review into three sections: identifying the distinct units of an acoustic sequence, describing the different ways that information can be contained within a sequence, and analysing the structure of that sequence. Each of these sections is further subdivided to address the key questions and approaches in that area. We propose a uniform, systematic, and comprehensive approach to studying sequences, with the goal of clarifying research terms used in different fields, and facilitating collaboration and comparative studies. Allowing greater interdisciplinary collaboration will facilitate the investigation of many important questions in the evolution of communication and sociality.},

	abstract = {Dietary protein is often considered a factor that limits the growth of primate populations. The ratio of crude protein (CP) to fiber in common mature leaves in a forest reliably predicts colobine biomass across Africa and Asia. This relationship is puzzling because CP of mature leaves is notably high in some forests, including Kibale National Park, Uganda, where mature leaves have a higher protein concentration (ca. 18\% CP on a dry matter basis) than what is required for primate growth, maintenance, and reproduction. We used an in vitro assay that incorporates the role of fiber and tannins to assess the biological relevance of CP in the leaves that comprise the diets of colobines (Colobus guereza, Piliocolobus tephrosceles) in Kibale (N = 37 spp. mature leaves, 39 spp. young leaves). Relative to CP, available (digestible) protein (AP) concentrations were 50\% lower in mature leaves and 38\% lower in young leaves, and protein-to-fiber ratios were lower when incorporating AP. Surprisingly, leaf AP did not differ among sites within Kibale, and AP at all sites exceeded primate protein requirements. Future research, particularly in protein-rich forests like Kibale, should consider focusing on fiber, energy, and other nutritional factors to assess the relationship between colobine biomass and leaf nutritional quality. Our study expands on the way that primate ecologists measure protein, integrates several traits into a single currency of AP, and contributes to conservation management plans.},

We examined patterns of association among age, sex, and reproductive classes of chimpanzees at Ngogo in the Kibale National Park, Uganda. We employed a class-based association index and a randomization procedure to control for confounding factors and to test for differences between classes. Results indicate that males associated with other males significantly more than expected if all classes behaved equivalently, while females generally associated with individuals of the same sex less than expected. To interpret these patterns we used two additional indices that separate associations into two components: general gregariousness and preference for particular classes of associates. Males and estrous females were more gregarious than other classes, while anestrous females were less so. After controlling for general gregariousness, adult males as a class showed no specific preference for associating with each other. Anestrous females preferred each other as party members, and estrous females avoided each other. These results are consistent with previous findings that adult males are more gregarious than females. They diverge from the standard picture of chimpanzee society, however, by suggesting a mutual affinity among anestrous females, but not among adult males as a class.},

This raises the question of whether social norms are indeed causal drivers of behaviour and can convincingly explain major cooperation-related regularities. Here, we show that the norm of conditional cooperation provides such an explanation, that powerful methods for its empirical identification exist and that social norms have causal effects. Norm compliance rests on fundamental human motives (‘social preferences’) that also imply a willingness to punish free-riders, but normative constraints on peer punishment are important for its effectiveness and welfare properties. If given the chance, a large majority of people favour the imposition of such constraints through the migration to institutional environments that enable the normative guidance of cooperation and norm enforcement behaviours.},

Work in this area has already provided some elegant experimental tests of social evolutionary theory, demonstrating the importance of factors such as relatedness, kin discrimination, competition between relatives, and enforcement of cooperation.

We explore how wild vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) respond to heat stress, and how behavioral adaptations are used to regulate body temperature. Materials and methods We implanted wild vervet monkeys with temperature-sensitive data loggers and related the body temperature rhythms of these animals to their use of thermoregulatory behaviors. Results Environmental temperature had a positive effect on the mean, minima and maxima of daily body temperatures. Environmental temperature had a positive effect on the amount of time that vervet monkeys spent in the shade, and animals that spent more time in the shade had lower body temperature maxima. Drinking water did not have a proximate effect on body temperature, most likely a consequence of their regular access to drinking water. Body temperatures were observed to decrease after swimming events, but tended to return to pre-swim temperatures within 1 hr, suggesting a limited thermal benefit of this behavior. Conclusions Our data support the view that vervet monkeys cope well in the heat, and use behavior as a means to aid thermoregulation. The ability of primates to be flexible in their use of thermoregulatory behaviors can contribute positively to their capacity to cope with environmental variability. However, given its broad effect on plant productivity and habitat loss, climate change is a major threat to species' biogeographical distribution and survival.},

	abstract = {Short birth intervals have long been linked to adverse child outcomes in humans. However, it remains unclear the extent to which the birth interval has a direct influence on offspring mortality, independent of the confounding effects of modern environments and human sociocultural practices on reproductive behavior. Outside of humans, the relationship between birth intervals and offspring mortality has been rarely tested, leaving an open question of how much the findings from humans imply evolutionarily conserved mechanisms. Here, using ∼9,000 birth records from ∼1,400 free-ranging rhesus macaque mothers, we show that short birth intervals preceding or succeeding the birth of an offspring are both associated with higher offspring mortality, after controlling for heterogeneity across mothers and birth cohorts. We clarify that the mortality risk of a short birth interval to an offspring is contingent on the survival of its older or younger sibling, the condition that reduces maternal resources for investment in the offspring. This finding suggests that life-history tradeoffs between offspring quantity (a short birth interval) and quality (offspring survival) form an evolutionary force shaping variation in birth intervals. Consistent with the well-known observation made in humans, we also found a nonlinear relationship between the preceding interbirth interval and infant mortality. The overall congruence with the findings from the human literature indicates a robust relationship between birth intervals and offspring mortality.},

Studies of time-series of leaf-unfolding, flowering and fruiting over the last 50 yr in central Catalonia were carried out, and greenup onset in the Iberian Peninsula was monitored by satellite images. • Experimental, historical and geographical changes in rainfall produced significant, complex and strongly species-specific, as well as spatially and temporally variable, phenological effects. Among these changes, it was found that in the Iberian Peninsula, greenup onset changes from spring (triggered by rising temperatures) in the northern cool-wet regions to autumn (triggered by the arrival of autumn rainfalls) in the southern warm-dry regions. Even in the mesic Mediterranean central Catalonia (NE of the peninsula) rainfall had a stronger relative influence than temperature on fruiting phenology. • The results show that changes in rainfall and water availability, an important driver of climate change, can cause complex phenological changes with likely far-reaching consequences for ecosystem and biosphere functioning and structure. The seasonal shift in the Iberian Peninsula further highlights this importance and indicates that vegetation may respond to climate change not only with gradual, but also with abrupt temporal and spatial, changes in the timing of greenup onset.},

What is poorly known is whether and how phenological responses to climate warming will differ from year to year, season to season, habitat to habitat, or species to species. Here, we present 5 y of phenological responses to experimental warming for 10 subboreal tree species. Research took place in the open-air B4WarmED experiment in Minnesota. The design is a two habitat (understory and open) × three warming treatments (ambient, +1.7 °C, +3.4 °C) factorial at two sites. Phenology was measured twice weekly during the growing seasons of 2009 through 2013. We found significant interannual variation in the effect of warming and differences among species in response to warming that relate to geographic origin and plant functional group. Moreover, responses to experimental temperature variation were similar to responses to natural temperature variation. Warming advanced the date of budburst more in early compared to late springs, suggesting that to simulate interannual variability in climate sensitivity of phenology, models should employ process-based or continuous development approaches. Differences among species in timing of budburst were also greater in early compared to late springs. Our results suggest that climate change—which will make most springs relatively “early”—could lead to a future with more variable phenology among years and among species, with consequences including greater risk of inappropriately early leafing and altered interactions among species.},

However, greater understanding of the electivity index and nutrition of forage species along the edge of the protected area can be used to reduce the gaur-human conflict by keeping gaur in KYNP. Reducing the large monoculture areas that is the food sources of gaur along the edge may reduce or prevent gaur leaving the park and can be applied to advance conservation actions.},

	abstract = {Phenology is a key indicator of vegetation response to global change. Satellite observations from coarse resolution sensors (i.e., MODIS and AVHRR) have been widely used to study impacts of climate anomalies on vegetation phenology. The advantage of coarse resolution sensors are daily observations across the entire globe, but the coarse spatial resolution, as well as the relatively short time span covered by MODIS, are signiﬁcant drawbacks in analyzing landscape-scale trends in phenology. Time series data from the medium resolution sensor Landsat may overcome these issues. However, because of Landsat's lower observation frequency, phenological methods developed with coarse resolution data are not directly transferable. Here, we demonstrate a new Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework for estimating inter-annual variation in vegetation phenology from Landsat time series while controlling for spatial variation. The method pools all available observations to estimate the spatial variation in phenological parameters, while speciﬁcally modeling inter-annual variation as random effect terms. The advantage of a Bayesian approach is the ability to incorporate prior knowledge from other phenology and climate observations to reduce variability in the estimates, as well as a more robust estimation of uncertainty. We demonstrate and evaluate the modeling framework with a case study of changing spring phenology in broadleaved trees in the Bavarian Forest National Park in southern Germany. Results show that the model estimated the spatial and temporal variation in phenological parameters precisely. Temporal variation in start of season showed overall strong agreement with ground-based measures of bud-break variability (r = 0.82 [0.80–0.84]). Our proposed modeling framework will help to better monitor and understand changes in vegetation phenology at scales yet unexplored by the phenological community.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          From biofilms to whale pods, organisms have repeatedly converged on sociality as a strategy to improve individual fitness. Yet, it remains challenging to identify the most important drivers—and by extension, the evolutionary mechanisms—of sociality for particular species. Here, we present a conceptual framework, literature review, and model demonstrating that the direction and magnitude of the response of group size to sudden resource shifts provides a strong indication of the underlying drivers of sociality. We catalog six functionally distinct mechanisms related to the acquisition of resources, and we model these mechanisms’ effects on the survival of individuals foraging in groups. We find that whether, and to what degree, optimal group size increases, decreases, or remains constant when resource abundance declines depends strongly on the dominant mechanism. Existing empirical data support our model predictions, and we demonstrate how our framework can be used to predict the dominant social benefit for particular species. Together, our framework and results show that a single easily measurable characteristic, namely, group size under different resource abundances, can illuminate the potential drivers of sociality across the tree of life.},

Avoiding such discrepancies presents a challenge not only to practitioners of econometrics, but to all analysts in the data intensive sciences. This note describes graphical tools for understanding, visualizing, and resolving the problem through a series of illustrative examples. We have found that the examples presented here can serve as a powerful instructional device to supplement formal discussions of the problem.

	abstract = {Joint species distribution models (JSDM) are increasingly used to analyse community ecology data. Recent progress with JSDMs has provided ecologists with new tools for estimating species associations (residual co-occurrence patterns after accounting for environmental niches) from large data sets, as well as for increasing the predictive power of species distribution models (SDMs) by accounting for such associations. Yet, one critical limitation of JSDMs developed thus far is that they assume constant species associations. However, in real ecological communities, the direction and strength of interspecific interactions are likely to be different under different environmental conditions. In this paper, we overcome the shortcoming of present JSDMs by allowing species associations covary with measured environmental covariates. To estimate environmental-dependent species associations, we utilize a latent variable structure, where the factor loadings are modelled as a linear regression to environmental covariates. We illustrate the performance of the statistical framework with both simulated and real data. Our results show that JSDMs perform substantially better in inferring environmental-dependent species associations than single SDMs, especially with sparse data. Furthermore, JSDMs consistently overperform SDMs in terms of predictive power for generating predictions that account for environment-dependent biotic associations. We implemented the statistical framework as a MATLAB package, which includes tools both for model parameterization as well as for post-processing of results, particularly for addressing whether and how species associations depend on the environmental conditions. Our statistical framework provides a new tool for ecologists who wish to investigate from non-manipulative observational community data the dependency of interspecific interactions on environmental context. Our method can be applied to answer the fundamental questions in community ecology about how species’ interactions shift in changing environmental conditions, as well as to predict future changes of species’ interactions in response to global change.},

	abstract = {Phenology is a first-order control on productivity and mediates the biophysical environment by altering albedo, surface roughness length and evapotranspiration. Accurate and transparent modelling of vegetation phenology is therefore key in understanding feedbacks between the biosphere and the climate system. Here, we present the phenor r package and modelling framework. The framework leverages measurements of vegetation phenology from four common phenology observation datasets, the PhenoCam network, the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN), the Pan European Phenology Project (PEP725), MODIS phenology (MCD12Q2) combined with (global) retrospective and projected climate data. We show an example analysis, using the phenor modelling framework, which quickly and easily compares 20 included spring phenology models for three plant functional types. An analysis of model skill using the root mean squared (RMSE) error shows little or no difference regardless of model structure, corroborating previous studies. We argue that addressing this issue will require novel model development combined with easy data assimilation as facilitated by our framework. In conclusion, we hope the phenor phenology modelling framework in the r language and environment for statistical computing will facilitate reproducibility and community driven phenology model development, in order to increase their overall predictive power, and leverage an ever growing number of phenology data products.},

	abstract = {Network analysis has increasingly expanded our understanding of social structure in primates and other animal species. However, most studies use networks representing only one interaction type, when social relationships (and the emerging social structure) are the result of many types of interactions and their interplay through time. The recent development of tools facilitating the integrated analysis of multiple interaction types using multiplex networks has opened the possibility of extending the insight provided by social network analysis. We use a multiplex representation of interactions among the members of a group of wild Geoffroy’s spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi), to study their social structure. We constructed a six-layered multiplex network based on three indices of overt social interactions (aggression, embraces, grooming) and three distance-based indices (contact, proximity, and association). With tools provided by the MuxViz software, we assessed the relevance of including all six indices in our analysis, the role of individuals in the network (through node versatility), and the presence of modules and non-random triadic structures or motifs. The multiplex provided information which was not equivalent to any individual layer or to the simple aggregation of layers. Network patterns based on associations did not correspond with those observed for overt-interactions or for the multiplex structure. Males were the most versatile individuals, while multiplex modularity and motifs highlighted the relevance of different interaction types for the overall connectivity of the network. We conclude that the multiplex approach improves on previous methods by retaining valuable information from each interaction type and how it is patterned among individuals.},

	abstract = {Dietary responses to the habitat heterogeneity resulting from anthropogenic disturbance vary among primates. Some species alter their foraging strategy and continue to thrive in human-modified habitats while others are unable to modify their diets sufficiently to cope with such disturbance. Over a 12-mo period, we investigated the feeding ecology of the Omo River guereza (Colobus guereza guereza), a subspecies of black-and-white colobus monkeys endemic to Ethiopia, in a large continuous forest (Munessa: LC group), a smaller modified continuous forest (Wondo Genet: SC group), and a tiny forest fragment (Aregash: F group). We found that the forest fragment had higher tree stem densities but lower overall tree basal area than the continuous forests. In all three forests, guerezas were mostly folivorous (LC group: 83\%; SC group: 65\%; F group: 62\%) and consumed young leaves in accordance with their availability. However, in addition to these broad dietary similarities, there were several differences between forests suggesting strategies guerezas may use to cope with habitat heterogeneity in southern Ethiopia. We found that guerezas in anthropogenically altered forests relied less on mature leaves and more on whole fruits (F group) or flowers (SC group) than guerezas in large continuous forest (LC group). Guerezas also devoted large percentages of their feeding time to exotic species in disturbed forests (SC group: 49.0\%; F group: 20.6\%) but not in the large continuous forest (LC group: 0.0\%). Lastly, guerezas in disturbed forests had richer diets (F group, N = 37 species, SC group, N = 32) than those in the large continuous forest (LC group, N = 27). Thus, our study found that within the folivorous dietary strategy of guerezas, there is considerable dietary variability among even neighboring populations experiencing different degrees of habitat fragmentation and degradation. This dietary flexibility may explain the relatively high tolerance of guerezas to human disturbance across their geographic distribution.},

	abstract = {The goal of this paper is to compare several widely used Bayesian model selection methods in practical model selection problems, highlight their differences and give recommendations about the preferred approaches. We focus on the variable subset selection for regression and classification and perform several numerical experiments using both simulated and real world data. The results show that the optimization of a utility estimate such as the cross-validation (CV) score is liable to finding overfitted models due to relatively high variance in the utility estimates when the data is scarce. This can also lead to substantial selection induced bias and optimism in the performance evaluation for the selected model. From a predictive viewpoint, best results are obtained by accounting for model uncertainty by forming the full encompassing model, such as the Bayesian model averaging solution over the candidate models. If the encompassing model is too complex, it can be robustly simplified by the projection method, in which the information of the full model is projected onto the submodels. This approach is substantially less prone to overfitting than selection based on CV-score. Overall, the projection method appears to outperform also the maximum a posteriori model and the selection of the most probable variables. The study also demonstrates that the model selection can greatly benefit from using cross-validation outside the searching process both for guiding the model size selection and assessing the predictive performance of the finally selected model.},

First, we show that, for five of the seven species, offspring face reduced survival during the years immediately preceding maternal death, while the mother is still alive. Second, we identify an intergenerational effect of early maternal loss in three species (muriquis, baboons, and blue monkeys), such that early maternal death experienced in one generation leads to reduced offspring survival in the next. Our results have important implications for the evolution of slow life histories in primates, as they suggest that maternal condition and survival are more important for offspring fitness than previously realized.},

	abstract = {The construction of rank hierarchies based on agonistic interactions between two individuals (“dyads”) is an important component in the characterization of the social structure of groups. To this end, winner-loser matrices are typically created, which collapse the outcome of dyadic interactions over time, resulting in the loss of all information contained in the temporal domain. Methods that track changes in the outcome of dyadic interactions (such as “Elo-ratings”) are receiving increasing interest. Critically, individual ratings are not just based on the succession of wins and losses, but depend on the values of start ratings and a shift coefficient. Recent studies improved existing methods by introducing a point estimation of these auxiliary parameters on the basis of a maximum likelihood (ML) approach. For a sound assessment of the rank hierarchies generated this way, we argue that measures of uncertainty of the estimates, as well as a quantification of the robustness of the methods, are also needed. We introduce a Bayesian inference (BI) approach using “partial pooling”, which rests on the assumption that all start ratings are samples from the same distribution. We compare the outcome of the ML approach to that of the BI approach using real-world data. In addition, we simulate different scenarios to explore in which way the Elo-rating responds to social events (such as rank changes), and low numbers of observations. Estimates of the start ratings based on “partial pooling” are more robust than those based on ML, also in scenarios where some individuals have only few observations. Our simulations show that assumed rank differences may fall well within the “uncertain” range, and that low sampling density, unbalanced designs, and coalitionary leaps involving several individuals within the hierarchy may yield unreliable results. Our results support the view that Elo-rating can be a powerful tool in the analysis of social behaviour, when the data meet certain criteria. Assessing the uncertainty greatly aids in the interpretation of results. We advocate running simulation approaches to test how well Elo-ratings reflect the (simulated) true structure and how sensitive the rating is to true changes in the hierarchy.},

Humans often focus on how different we are from other animals. Certainly, there are some important differences, but more and more we are learning that we differ by degree rather than kind. We see these similarities most clearly when we look at human populations that live a more traditional, foraging lifestyle. Barsbai et al. compared more than 300 such foraging human populations with mammal and bird species living in the same environment across a wide array of environmental conditions (see the Perspective by Hill and Boyd). They found that all three groups converged with regard to foraging, social, and reproductive behaviors. Thus, adaptation to environmental selection shapes similar responses across a wide diversity of life forms.
Science, this issue p. 292; see also p. 235
Behavior is a way for organisms to respond flexibly to the environmental conditions they encounter. Our own species exhibits large behavioral flexibility and occurs in all terrestrial habitats, sharing these environments with many other species. It remains unclear to what extent a shared environment constrains behavior and whether these constraints apply similarly across species. Here, we show that foraging human populations and nonhuman mammal and bird species that live in a given environment exhibit high levels of similarity in their foraging, reproductive, and social behaviors. Our findings suggest that local conditions may select for similar behaviors in both humans and nonhuman animals.
Local conditions may select for similar foraging, social, and reproductive behaviors in humans, other mammals, and birds.

	abstract = {Maintaining the balance between costs and benefits is challenging for species living in complex and dynamic socio-ecological environments, such as primates, but also crucial for shaping life history, reproductive and feeding strategies. Indeed, individuals must decide to invest time and energy to obtain food, services and partners, with little direct feedback on the success of their investments. Whereas decision-making relies heavily upon cognition in humans, the extent to which it also involves cognition in other species, based on their environmental constraints, has remained a challenging question. Building mental representations relating behaviours and their long-term outcome could be critical for other primates, but there are actually very little data relating cognition to real socio-ecological challenges in extant and extinct primates. Here, we review available data illustrating how specific cognitive processes enable(d) modern primates and extinct hominins to manage multiple resources (e.g. food, partners) and to organize their behaviour in space and time, both at the individual and at the group level. We particularly focus on how they overcome fluctuating and competing demands, and select courses of action corresponding to the best possible packages of potential costs and benefits in reproductive and foraging contexts.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Existence and prevalence of economic behaviours among non-human primates’.},

This study had four objectives: i) to provide a baseline population assessment for the two largest populations of Rothschild’s giraffes in Kenya, ii) to assess whether there are differences in population structure between the two enclosed populations, iii) to assess the potential and possible implications of different management practices on enclosed giraffe populations to inform future decision-making, and iv) to add to the availability of information available about giraffes in the wild. I used individual identification to assess the size and structure of the two populations; in Soysambu Conservancy between May 2010 and January 2011, I identified 77 giraffes; in Lake Nakuru National Park between May 2011 and January 2012, I identified 89. Population structure differed significantly between the two sites; Soysambu Conservancy contained a high percentage of juveniles (34\%) and subadults (29\%) compared to Lake Nakuru NP, which contained fewer juveniles (5\%) and subadults (15\%). During the time of this study Soysambu Conservancy contained no lions while Lake Nakuru NP contained a high density of lions (30 lions per 100km2). Lions are the main predator of giraffes, and preferential predation on juvenile giraffes has previously been identified in Lake Nakuru NP. My results suggest that high lion density in Lake Nakuru NP may have influenced the structure of the giraffe population by removing juveniles and, consequently, may affect future population growth. I suggest that wildlife managers consider lion densities alongside breeding plans for Endangered species, since the presence of lions appears to influence the population structure of giraffes in enclosed habitats.},

While the effect of predators on populations is well established, disturbance by humans is increasingly being identified as affecting the behaviour and reproductive success of animals and can have significant impacts on their survival. We used a concurrent analysis of two adjacent giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis populations in Kenya to determine whether human activities and high predation affected their social networks. One study site was a premier tourist destination with a high volume of human activity in the form of tourist traffic and lodge infrastructure, alongside a high density of lions which preferentially prey on giraffe calves; the other was a private wildlife conservancy with minimal human activity and no lion population. Giraffes in both networks showed preferred associations and avoidances of other individuals, which were independent of space use. Bond strength was lower in the population exposed to high levels of human activity and lions, and the network had lower density and clustering, and shorter path lengths, suggesting that it was more fragmented. We suggest that human activity and predator density may influence the patterns of social interactions in giraffes and highlight the importance of understanding the impact of tourism and management on the survival and success of wild animal populations.},

	abstract = {Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) prey on a variety of vertebrates, mostly on red colobus (Procolobus spp.) where the two species are sympatric. Variation across population occurs in hunting frequency and success, in whether hunting is cooperative, i.e., payoffs to individual hunters increase with group size, and in the extent to which hunters coordinate their actions in space and time, and in the impact of hunting on red colobus populations. Also, hunting frequency varies over time within populations, for reasons that are unclear. We present new data on hunting by chimpanzees at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda, and combine them with earlier data (Mitani and Watts, 1999, Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 109: 439–454) to examine hunting frequency and success, seasonality, and cooperation. The Ngogo community is the largest and has the most males of any known community. Chimpanzees there mostly hunt red colobus and are much more successful and make many more kills per hunt than at other sites; they kill 6–12\% of the red colobus population annually. The number of kills and the offtake of meat per hunt increase with the number of hunters, but per capita meat intake is independent of hunting party size; this suggests that cheating occurs in large parties. Some behavioral cooperation occurs. Hunting success and estimated meat intake vary greatly among males, partly due to dominance rank effects. The high overall success rate leads to relatively high average per capita meat intake despite the large number of consumers. The frequency of hunts and of hunting patrols varies positively with the availability of ripe fruit; this is the first quantitative demonstration of a relationship between hunting frequency and the availability of other food, and implies that the chimpanzees hunt most when they can easily meet energy needs from other sources. We provide the first quantitative support for the argument that variation in canopy structure influences decisions to hunt red colobus because hunts are easier where the canopy is broken.},

	abstract = {Mate-guarding is an important determinant of male reproductive success in a number of species. Little is known however about the constraints of this behaviour, e.g. the associated energetic costs. We investigated these costs in long-tailed macaques where alpha males mate guard females to a lesser extent than predicted by the priority of access model. The study was carried out during two mating periods on three wild groups living in the Gunung Leuser National Park, Indonesia. We combined behavioural observations on males’ locomotion and feeding activity, GPS records of distance travelled and non-invasive measurements of urinary C-peptide (UCP), a physiological indicator of male energetic status. Mate-guarding led to a decrease in feeding time and fruit consumption suggesting a reduced intake of energy. At the same time, vertical locomotion was reduced, which potentially saved energy. These findings, together with the fact that we did not find an effect of mate-guarding on UCP levels, suggest that energy intake and expenditure was balanced during mate-guarding in our study males. Mate-guarding thus seems to not be energetically costly under all circumstances. Given that in strictly seasonal rhesus macaques, high-ranking males lose physical condition over the mating period, we hypothesise that the energetic costs of mate-guarding vary inter-specifically depending on the degree of seasonality and that males of non-strictly seasonal species might be better adapted to maintain balanced energetic condition year-round. Finally, our results illustrate the importance of combining behavioural assessments of both energy intake and expenditure with physiological measures when investigating energetic costs of behavioural strategies.},

	abstract = {We propose a method for examining and measuring the complexity of animal social networks that are characterized using association indices. The method focusses on the diversity of types of dyadic relationship within the social network. Binomial mixture models cluster dyadic relationships into relationship types, and variation in the preponderance and strength of these relationship types can be used to estimate association complexity using Shannon’s information index. We use simulated data to test the method and find that models chosen using integrated complete likelihood give estimates of complexity that closely reflect the true complexity of social systems, but these estimates can be downwardly biased by low-intensity sampling and upwardly biased by extreme overdispersion within components. We also illustrate the use of the method on two real datasets. The method could be extended for use on interaction rate data using Poisson mixture models or on multidimensional relationship data using multivariate mixture models.Significance statementAnimals from many species interact socially with multiple individuals, and these interactions form a social network. Pairs of individuals have social relationships that differ in their strength and type. This social complexity has long interested behavioural biologists, particularly in the context of social cognition. Measuring social complexity, however, presents challenges. We propose a new method for measuring the complexity of animal social networks. Our approach is based on quantifying variation in the strengths of social connections (measured using association indices) which we use to classify different types of pairwise relationships. We, then, use the number, strength and prevalence of these different types of relationships to measure association complexity. Our approach can be used to compare association complexity between populations and/or species. We provide code that researchers can use with their own datasets.},

How a species responds to rapid climate change is complicated. Paniw et al. used long-term data on the Kalahari meerkat, an arid specialist, to explore how predicted changes might affect population persistence over time. Warming and rainfall changes in one part of the year had a negative impact on survival and persistence, whereas similar changes during another part of the year had the opposite effect. Understanding such variability will be essential as we attempt to understand the broader influence of climate change.
Science, this issue p. 631
Species in extreme habitats increasingly face changes in seasonal climate, but the demographic mechanisms through which these changes affect population persistence remain unknown. We investigated how changes in seasonal rainfall and temperature influence vital rates and viability of an arid environment specialist, the Kalahari meerkat, through effects on body mass. We show that climate change–induced reduction in adult mass in the prebreeding season would decrease fecundity during the breeding season and increase extinction risk, particularly at low population densities. In contrast, a warmer nonbreeding season resulting in increased mass and survival would buffer negative effects of reduced rainfall during the breeding season, ensuring persistence. Because most ecosystems undergo seasonal climate variations, a full understanding of species vulnerability to global change relies on linking seasonal trait and population dynamics.
Seasonal climate changes influence meerkat demographics differently.

All ateline genera experienced either an immediate or a lagged negative effect of El Niño events.

Furthermore, frugivorous primates showed a high degree of interspecific population synchrony over large scales across Central and South America attributable to the recent trends in large-scale climate.

The role that females — particularly mothers — play in harming infants is often overlooked, as it appears an evolutionary paradox. Life-history theory offers potential explanations, as females are under pressure to time births optimally, produce an optimal number of offspring and secure paternal investment. Furthermore, socio-cultural circumstances across human societies may favour sex-specific infanticide. These constraints can lead mothers to terminate pre- or post-natal investment in current offspring. Incorporating evolutionary theory in policy making may offer opportunities to assess which measures are likely to reduce the rate of maternally committed infanticide.},

	abstract = {Animals have evolved complex foraging strategies to obtain a nutritionally balanced diet and associated fitness benefits. Recent advances in nutrition research, combining state-space models of nutritional geometry with agent-based models of systems biology, show how nutrient targeted foraging behavior can also influence animal social interactions, ultimately affecting collective dynamics and group structures. Here we demonstrate how social network analyses can be integrated into such a modeling framework and provide a tangible and practical analytical tool to compare experimental results with theory. We illustrate our approach by examining the case of nutritionally mediated dominance hierarchies. First we show how nutritionally explicit agent-based models that simulate the emergence of dominance hierarchies can be used to generate social networks. Importantly the structural properties of our simulated networks bear similarities to dominance networks of real animals (where conflicts are not always directly related to nutrition). Finally, we demonstrate how metrics from social network analyses can be used to predict the fitness of agents in these simulated competitive environments. Our results highlight the potential importance of nutritional mechanisms in shaping dominance interactions in a wide range of social and ecological contexts. Nutrition likely influences social interaction in many species, and yet a theoretical framework for exploring these effects is currently lacking. Combining social network analyses with computational models from nutritional ecology may bridge this divide, representing a pragmatic approach for generating theoretical predictions for nutritional experiments.},

	abstract = {Many social species maintain differentiated relationships with their group members. These social bonds may reflect short-term interactions satisfying immediate needs. Alternatively, individuals of some species may entertain stable and valuable bonds that last much longer than opportunistic interactions would predict. This claim is supported by recent research that revealed clear fitness benefits for long-lasting social bonds. Here, we investigated the stability and equitability of social relationships in captive rhesus macaques, measured using their proximity and grooming patterns over a 3-yr period. We show that, in general, proximity patterns of the whole group were stable over 3 yr. More specifically, each individual’s top two nonkin within and between sex relationships based on proximity were relatively stable and some of these relationships lasted the full 3 yr. Female grooming relationships within and between sex were also stable over 3 yr. Moreover, strong social bonds in females were not based on age similarity and were not sex specific, suggesting that a general underlying mechanism of social bonding in female rhesus macaques. In contrast, patterns of male grooming of other males and of females were relatively unstable and male social bonds were less equitable than those of females. The differences in stability of the relationships between the sexes may reflect the dispersal pattern of rhesus macaques, although we have limited data on non-natal males in our study. With these data we add to a growing body of literature describing the value and durability of relationships among primates and other species.},

While VPT in apes is proven, its presence in monkeys is much-debated. Several different paradigms have been developed to test its existence, but all face interpretational problems since results can be explained by simpler cognitive mechanisms than VPT. Therefore, we adjusted one method where two individuals compete for access to food, visible or invisible for the dominant competitor, to preclude cognitively simpler mechanisms. The subordinate long-tailed macaques tested, selected significantly more often the food item invisible than the item visible to the dominant. In most trials, subjects retrieved only one food item and preferred the invisible food item. Surprisingly, they occasionally adopted an alternative strategy to obtain both food items, by first choosing the visible, most at risk food item. Faster animals adopted this strategy proportionally more often than slower ones. Contrary to previous research, our results cannot be explained by simpler cognitive mechanisms, since behavioural reading was prevented by a one-way mirror between the competitor and the food, and accessibility was equal to both food items. This is the first unequivocal evidence of VPT in a monkey species, suggesting that this precursor to ToM is an evolutionarily conserved capacity present in monkeys, apes and humans.},

Primates are well aware of the complex social structure within their group and infer information about social status by observing interactions of others. A capacity used to infer this information, Visual Perspective Taking (VPT), is present in apes and in monkeys. However, it is unclear whether monkeys really understand that another individual is looking at a specific target. We investigated whether monkeys understand the target of attention of conspecifics using a new paradigm, based on expectancy violation. Subjects were exposed to pictures of scenes involving group members. These pictures either represented congruent (agonistic signals consistent with the dominance hierarchy) or incongruent (signals contradict the dominance hierarchy) social situations. The only difference between scenes concerned the looking direction, that is, the target of attention, and facial expression of the central monkey in the picture. Female subjects did not differ in their looking times to incongruent and congruent scenes, but results may be confounded by their longer looking times at scenes involving kin than non-kin. Male subjects looked significantly longer at incongruent than congruent scenes, suggesting that they understand the target of attention of other individuals. Alternative explanations involving simpler cognitive capacities were excluded. This implies that monkey species share social cognitive capacities underlying VPT with apes and humans. Am. J.

	abstract = {Introductions of new males into captive primate groups are often necessary to prevent inbreeding, but also bear high social risks. To minimize these risks, it is crucial to understand the social behaviour accompanying male introductions. While the behaviour of new males is generally understood, information on resident female behaviour during introductions is lacking. We studied female behaviour towards the new male during introductions of three adult male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta)—each into a different captive group. All three males were successfully introduced; respectively 100\%, 92\%, and 83\% of the females tolerated the male as a group-member at the end of the introductions. Older females started tolerating the male significantly faster than younger females, while no additional effect of female dominance rank, fertility, or the number of female coalitionary partners on timing of tolerance was found. During the course of the integration, female aggression and submission towards the male, and male mating access decreased, while female affiliation towards the male increased. The increase of female tolerance and the changes in social behaviour were similar between the introductions, indicating a general pattern in female behaviour, although some variation in effect size and significance level was observed. Based on these results, we suggest that low female submission levels towards an introduced male may constitute a criterion to assess the risk of leaving the male in the group full-time. Moreover, low female aggression levels at the end of the introduction may signal long-term group stability. Overall, we conclude that female behaviour can provide valuable information about the male introduction process and should not be overlooked.},

However, obtaining detailed data on variation in energetic condition, and its biological consequences, has been a considerable challenge. In the past 20years, tremendous strides have been made towards non-invasive methods for monitoring the physiology of animals in their natural environment. These methods provide detailed, individualized data about energetic condition, as well as energy allocations to growth, reproduction, and somatic health. In doing so, they add much-needed resolution by which to move beyond correlative studies to research programs that can discriminate causes from effects and disaggregate multiple correlated features of the social and physical environment. In this review, I describe the conceptual and methodological approaches for studying primate energetics. I then discuss the core questions about primate feeding ecology, social behavior, and life history that can benefit from physiological studies, highlighting the ways in which recent research has done so. Among these are studies that test, and often refute, common assumptions about how feeding ecology shapes primate biology, and those that reveal proximate associations between energetics and reproductive strategies.},

Such disparities are attributed to hypothesized differences in environmental selective pressures that structure association patterns. However, recent research documents greater within-species variation in social bonds in both species. Here, we examine grooming networks in captive chimpanzees at the North Carolina Zoo, and captive bonobos at the Columbus Zoo. We hypothesized that male–female grooming relationships would be the strongest in both species, but that males and females of both species would not significantly differ between centrality, strength, or clustering. Via Mantel tests, we found that neither bonobos (t = − 0.070, r = − 0.009, two-tailed p = 0.942) nor chimpanzees (t = − 0.495, r = − 0.0939, two-tailed p = 0.6205) had significant differences in grooming between or within sexes. Neither species had significant sex differences in centrality, strength, or clustering. To account for idiosyncratic factors affecting grooming distribution, we examined the effect of origin, kinship, and group tenure on social network position. We found that wild-born bonobos exhibited greater eigenvector centrality (t = − 2.592, df = 9, p = 0.29) and strength (t = − 2.401; df = 9, p = 0.040), and group tenure was significantly correlated with strength (r = 0.608; N = 11, p − 0 = 0.47). None of these factors varied with social network position in chimpanzees. Our findings suggest that in captive settings, idiosyncratic factors related to individual history play a greater role in structuring social networks. Such variation may point to the behavioral flexibility inherent in fission–fusion networks, and mirror between-site variation found in wild chimpanzees. However, some idiosyncratic factors shaping captive networks may be an artifact of captivity.},

	abstract = {Animal and human societies exhibit extreme diversity in the size, composition and cohesion of their social units, in the patterning of sex-specific reproductive skew, in the nature of parental care, in the form and frequency of cooperation and in their competitive regime, creating a diversity of socially complex societies. However, there is an ongoing debate about whether social complexity is a real, emergent property of a society or whether it only provides a conceptual framework for studying the diversity and evolution of societies. In this introduction to our topical collection, we identify three areas of current research addressing relevant challenges in the study of social complexity. First, previous studies have suffered from a lack of a common conceptual framework, including shared definitions, and existing measures of social complexity do not acknowledge its multiple components and dimensions. Second, most previous studies have ignored intraspecific variation, and the proximate and ultimate determinants of variation in social complexity, as well as their interactions, remain poorly known. Third, comparative studies of social complexity offer opportunities to explore its biological causes and correlates and but it is frequently difficult to identify the causal relationships involved and the development of general insights has been hampered by conceptual and methodological difficulties. In this paper, we briefly characterize these three challenges and offer guidance to the other contributions to this topical collection on social complexity by placing their key results in the context of these three topics.},

	abstract = {Social complexity has been one of the recent emerging topics in the study of animal and human societies, but the concept remains both poorly defined and understood. In this paper, I critically review definitions and studies of social complexity in invertebrate and vertebrate societies, arguing that the concept is being used inconsistently in studies of vertebrate sociality. Group size and cohesion define one cornerstone of social complexity, but the nature and patterning of social interactions contribute more to interspecific variation in social complexity in species with individual recognition and repeated interactions. Humans provide the only example where many other unique criteria are used, and they are the only species for which intraspecific variation in social complexity has been studied in detail. While there is agreement that complex patterns emerge at the group level as a result of simple interactions and as a result of cognitive abilities, there is consensus neither on their relative importance nor on the role of specific cognitive abilities in different lineages. Moreover, aspects of reproduction and parental care have also been invoked to characterize levels of social complexity, so that no single comprehensive measure is readily available. Because even fundamental components of social complexity are difficult to compare across studies and species because of inconsistent definitions and operationalization of key social traits, I define and characterize social organization, social structure, mating system, and care system as distinct components of a social system. Based on this framework, I outline how different aspects of the evolution of social complexity are being studied and suggest questions for future research.},

While many studies take the observed patterns of inter-individual interactions as products and proxies of pure social processes, or as links between resource availability and social structure, the role of the physical configuration of habitat features in shaping the social system of group-living animals remains largely overlooked. We hypothesise that by shaping the decisions about when and where to move, physical features of the environment will impact which individuals more frequently encounter one another and in doing so the overall social structure and social organization of populations. We first discuss how the spatial arrangement of habitat components (i.e. habitat configuration) can shape animal movements using empirical cases in the literature. Then, we draw from the empirical literature to discuss how movement patterns of individuals mediate the patterns of social interactions and social organization and highlight the role of network-based approaches in identifying, evaluating and partitioning the effects of habitat configuration on animal social structure or organization. We illustrate the combination of these mechanisms using a simple simulation. Finally, we discuss the implications of habitat configuration in shaping the ecology and evolution of animal societies and offer a framework for future studies. We highlight future directions for studies in animal societies that are increasingly important in widely human-modified landscapes, in particular the implications of habitat-driven social structure in evolution.},

	abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models have increasingly replaced mixed-model analyses of variance for statistical inference in factorial psycholinguistic experiments. Although LMMs have many advantages over ANOVA, like ANOVAs, setting them up for data analysis also requires some care. One simple option, when numerically possible, is to ﬁt the full variancecovariance structure of random effects (the maximal model; Barr, Levy, Scheepers \& Tily, 2013), presumably to keep Type I error down to the nominal a in the presence of random effects. Although it is true that ﬁtting a model with only random intercepts may lead to higher Type I error, ﬁtting a maximal model also has a cost: it can lead to a signiﬁcant loss of power. We demonstrate this with simulations and suggest that for typical psychological and psycholinguistic data, higher power is achieved without inﬂating Type I error rate if a model selection criterion is used to select a random effect structure that is supported by the data.},

	abstract = {Brain asymmetry—i.e. the specialisation of each cerebral hemisphere for sensorimotor processing mechanisms and for specific cognitive functions—is widely distributed among vertebrates. Several factors, such as embryological manipulations, sex, age, and breeds, can influence the maintenance, strength, and direction of laterality within a certain vertebrate species. Brain lateralisation is a universal phenomenon characterising not only cerebral control of cognitive or emotion-related functions but also cerebral regulation of somatic processes, and its evolution is strongly influenced by social selection pressure. Diseases are well known to be a cost of sociality but their role in influencing behaviour has received very little attention. The present study investigates the influence of illness conditions as a source of variation on laterality in a social keystone vertebrate predator model, the lion. In a preliminary stage, the clinical conditions of 24 adult lions were assessed. The same animals were scored for forelimb preference when in the quadrupedal standing position. Lions show a marked forelimb preference with a population bias towards the use of the right forelimb. Illness conditions strongly influenced the strength of laterality bias, with a significant difference between clinically healthy and sick lions. According to these results, health conditions should be recognised as an important source of variation in brain lateralisation.},

Estimates of body composition provide insight into an animal's energetic state, potential for reproduction and survival, and quality of habitat they occupy. We validated accuracy of in vivo and post-mortem indices to predict total body fat in mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). Rump fat thickness measured using ultrasonography was related linearly to ingesta-free body fat, but disappeared at ∼5.6\% body fat. Loin muscle thickness determined by ultrasonography and condition scores exhibited potential to quantify nutritional reserves when rump fat has been depleted. Whole body mass did not predict body fat in adult females, but was a good predictor of ingesta-free lean body mass. Kidney fat mass and kidney fat index were moderate predictors of total body fat, but the relationship was curvilinear. Of the post-mortem indices we tested, the Kistner Score exhibited the strongest linear relationship to ingesta-free body fat. We suggest that using an accurate in vivo method to assess nutritional reserves reveals much about past nutritional history and future productivity of individuals within a population, especially when determined repeatedly in radiocollared animals.]},

A scoring system was developed to assess body and skin condition, blowhole cyamids, and rake marks in over 200 000 photographs. Comparison of body condition scores of females during calving and noncalving years found that females were significantly thinner in calving years and in the year after calving compared with the year before calving, showing that changes in body condition known to occur during the reproductive cycle can be successfully evaluated from photographs. Comparison of scores for all parameters between living whales and whales with more than a 5-year gap in sighting history ("presumed dead") found that presumed dead whales received health assessment scores indicating compromised health with body condition emerging as a key visual indicator. This health assessment method provides a new tool to monitor health trends in right whales at individual and population levels and may provide a model for assessments of other well-photographed cetaceans.},

	volume = {4},
	abstract = {Vertical aerial photographs were collected of gray whales migrating along the California Coast between 1994 and 1998 to readdress some published findings on the biology and life history of this population based on examination of specimens. For each whale, an attempt was made to measure standard total length, the width of the whale at its widest point, the distance from the tip of the rostrum to the widest point, and the width of the flukes. For southbound gray whales, early migrants were longer on average and more likely to be parturient than those migrating later. Near-term pregnant females were wider relative to their length than other southbound gray whales. This difference was easily detected by visual inspection of the images and through statistical evaluation of length and width data. There was 100\% agreement between identification of parturient females based on linear regression analysis of length and width and discriminate analysis of all measurements. Based on the proportion of parturient females to those with calves during sampling of southbound whales, the median calving date was estimated to be 13 January. Southbound calves averaged 4.6m in length; those photographed northbound in late April, at an age of about three months, averaged 7.1m. Average length for yearlings, based on combined southbound and northbound data, was 8.5m. Residuals from a regression of width on length were compared, and significant changes in the relationship were detected which were consistent with changes in nutritive condition or fatness described from examination of whales taken along the California Coast between 1959 and 1969 (Rice and Wolman, 1971). Parturient females were the widest relative to their length and northbound cows with calves were the narrowest in the sample. The relationship between length and width for migrating gray whales that were not parturient or associated with a calf, showed that southbound gray whales were significantly wider than northbound whales photographed approximately 60 days later. These results indicate that the predictable but relatively small changes in condition or fatness of gray whales associated with fasting during their winter migration can be reliably detected in measurements from vertical aerial photographs.},

Finding fruits amid tropical foliage has long been proffered as an adaptive explanation for primate trichromacy, yet there is a dearth of systematic evaluations of frugivory as an ecological selective force. We studied the behavioral ecology of wild capuchins (Cebus capucinus) in northwestern Costa Rica across the annual cycle and modeled the ability of three dichromatic and three trichromatic phenotypes to discriminate fruits from leaves, a task that represents long-distance search for food patches in a tropical forest. Models of the trichromatic phenotypes could correctly discriminate approximately three-quarters of the total capuchin dietary fruits from leaves, including some fruits subjectively classified as having “cryptic” (greenish-brownish) hues. In contrast, models of dichromatic phenotypes could discriminate fewer than one-third of the fruits. This pattern held when we restricted our analysis to only the most heavily consumed diet items, preferred foods, or seasonally critical species. We in addition highlight the potential of fruit species with small patch sizes to confer an advantage to trichromats, as these resources are anticipated to provide a high finder’s reward. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that long-distance detection of fruit patches exerts a selective pressure on trichromacy in neotropical primates, and suggest that greenish-brownish fruits might have played an underappreciated role in the evolution of primate color vision.},

	abstract = {The ability to increase energy storage when food is abundant for later use during late gestation and early lactation is often considered the primary benefit of the capital breeding strategy (clustering conceptions during high food periods, HFP) that promotes reproductive success among females living in unpredictable environments. Capital breeding, however, may also enable preconceptive females to increase hormone production for ovulation, which has been linked to energetic condition in capital breeders, and/or allow females entering the subsequent HFP to increase their energetic condition in order to continue nursing unweaned infants. Here, we investigate whether capital breeding provides these additional benefits in 16 female Sanje mangabeys (Cercocebus sanjei) and determine the dietary strategies used to increase energetic condition (measured by urinary C-peptide: UCP) during the HFP. Fecal estradiol (fE2) and UCP were negatively correlated with number of cycles before conception (r = −0.591, r = −0.646, P {\textless} 0.01) and were highest in conceptive cycles. Both peri-conceptive (preconception and early gestation) and non-peri-conceptive (lactation) females increased energetic condition over the HFP (r = 0.612, r = 0.583, P {\textless} 0.001) by increasing dietary fat (r = 0.619, r = 0.703, P {\textless} 0.001) and, for non-peri-conceptive females, protein (r = 0.437, P {\textless} 0.001). Feeding intake rate (FIR) and time spent foraging and feeding did not change over the HFP; however, non-peri-conceptive females exhibited a faster FIR compared to peri-conceptive females (t = −2.324, P {\textless} 0.05), consuming almost twice as much food per unit time. The results of this study confirm that Sanje mangabeys benefit in multiple phases of the reproductive cycle by using capital breeding, which may explain how this strategy promotes female reproductive success.

The low quality diet simulated the energy and protein intake of an adult female during drought range conditions. During the peak breeding season (Jan-Feb) in 1985, a daily breeding program was implemented to monitor estrous behavior and fertility. All females were sacrificed after approximately 15 weeks. Three of 6 receiving the low quality diet showed no behavioral signs of estrus, whereas all females fed the high quality diet were bred. Duration of estrus averaged 1.3 and 3.5 days for cycling females on low and high quality diets, respectively. Only 1 of the 3 cycling females on the low quality diet became pregnant, whereas 6 out of 7 cycling females on the high quality diet became pregnant. Ovarian examination revealed ≤50\% of the females receiving the low quality diet for 10 weeks entered the peak breeding season in an anestrous condition.

	abstract = {The quantification of nutritional status (e.g., total body fat) of animals is difficult, because the linear dimension (body length) required for the calculation of proxy parameters, such as the physique or body mass indices, cannot be measured without capture. One solution is photogrammetry of body length, provided the following two criteria are met: (1) the camera axes and subject are oriented vertically, and (2) anatomical landmarks are easily identified with low measurement error. By modifying Mori’s (Primates 20:371–397, 1979) approach, we devised an accurate photogrammetric method that uses a horizontal bar with an attached ruler for the monkey to traverse, and the anatomical landmarks of the eye and upper border of the ischial callosity to measure body length. We tested the applicability of this method on 11 adult female, habituated, free-ranging Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). Somatometric body length (crown–rump length and anterior trunk length) was statistically compared with the body length obtained using photogrammetry. The significant correlation of the photogrammetric body length with each somatometric measurement verified that the former could be employed to calculate various indices that are used to characterize fat mass (nutritional status) in Japanese macaques. The advantages and disadvantages of photogrammetry are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Ecological conditions, feeding and ranging behaviour as well as physical condition of female Hanuman langurs (Presbytis entellus) were studied in order to analyse the major influences on the timing of reproductive events. The langurs inhabited a semi-evergreen forest dominated by Sal trees (Skorea robusta). The climate was dominated by the summer monsoon lasting from May to September. Availability of plant phytophases was markedly seasonal, with fruiting as well as flushing of the six main food plants during the monsoon. Feeding and ranging behaviour of the females varied with food availability and its distribution. High dietary quality was only obtained during a short period from May to July. Physical condition of the females varied in accordance with dietary quality and energy expenditure, with a good physical condition during the second half of the year. Births occurred from January until June, with most births around the energetically worst period of the year. The results indicate that, in contrast to several other non-human primates, most females of this population gave birth too early to meet the optimum lactation requirements. Complete weaning mainly took place during an energetically bad time of the year (October to December). However, it can be inferred that the reduction of suckling bouts prior to the next conception took place when high quality food was available. Conceptions were confined to the months of July to November, coinciding with the time of best physical condition. Moreover, females who conceived were in a better physical condition than those who failed to conceive, suggesting a primary influence of nutrition on the probability of conception. Seasonality and timing of births may be the result of a regular seasonal shortfall of resources influencing the ability of the females to ovulate and to conceive.},

During this period a mast fruiting occurred, resulting in large fluctuations in fruit availability, measured by monitoring of 558 orangutan fruit trees. Orangutan diet varied tremendously in accordance with these fluctuations. During the month of highest fruit production, 100\% of the orangutan diet was composed of fruit. In contrast, during the fruit-poor period as little as 21\% of the diet was fruit, while 37\% was bark. Nutritional analyses of 78 of the foods most commonly eaten during this study show that mast foods were significantly higher in caloric content than were nonmast foods, which translates into substantial changes in caloric intake. During the month of highest fruit consumption (January), males consumed an estimated 8422 kcal/day and females consumed 7404 kcal/day. During the month of lowest fruit consumption (May), males consumed 3824 kcal/day and females consumed 1793 kcal/day. These differences were significantly different between the 2 months for both males and females. In May, males ate significantly more kcal/day than females did. Time spent feeding did not differ between the two periods for either males or females. I assessed the impact of these changes in diet and caloric intake on orangutan physiological functioning by measuring ketones in 257 urine samples collected from adult males and females. Ketones—products of fat metabolism—were present in urine only during the fruit-poor period. These data suggest that orangutans are highly efficient at storing fat during fruit-rich periods and utilizing the reserves during times of fruit shortfall. This response may have important implications for orangutan survivorship, reproduction, and behavior.},

We developed a Brownian bridge movement model (BBMM) for estimating the expected movement path of an animal, using discrete location data obtained at relatively short time intervals. The BBMM is based on the properties of a conditional random walk between successive pairs of locations, dependent on the time between locations, the distance between locations, and the Brownian motion variance that is related to the animal's mobility. We describe two critical developments that enable widespread use of the BBMM, including a derivation of the model when location data are measured with error and a maximum likelihood approach for estimating the Brownian motion variance. After the BBMM is fitted to location data, an estimate of the animal's probability of occurrence can be generated for an area during the time of observation. To illustrate potential applications, we provide three examples: estimating animal home ranges, estimating animal migration routes, and evaluating the influence of fine-scale resource selection on animal movement patterns.},

	abstract = {Allonursing, the nursing of nonoffspring, is a form of cooperative breeding. To test the kin-selection allonursing hypothesis, we selected 2 experimental groups, based on genetic relatedness, to assess whether evidence of individual and daily patterns of kin-related allonursing would emerge. Each group consisted of 8 mother–offspring pairs, and observers monitored each group over 5 weeks, starting when the offspring were between 8 and 23 days old. One group of 8 mothers was selected to be closely related, and the other group of 8 mothers was selected to be distantly related, based on genetic relatedness. We recorded 1,652 solicitations, of which 869 were nursing bouts and 161 were allonursing bouts. All mothers nursed their own offspring, and 15 of the 16 mothers allonursed. In both groups, 7 of the 8 offspring were allonursed. The offspring of closely related mothers were allonursed more often than the offspring of distantly related mothers, and we found evidence for this pattern at the individual level and daily over 5 weeks. Our results supported the kin-selection hypothesis but not the compensation hypothesis. We suggest that allonursing may have provided adaptive and nutritional benefits related to kin selection, and offspring from the closely related group may have gained more nutritional benefits and more mass than offspring from the distantly related group. We presented evidence that allonursing contributions detected can depend upon the research design. Furthermore, we suggest that the indirect fitness benefits of alloparental care may have been overestimated, and that kin selection alone is not sufficient to explain alloparental care in cooperative breeding social systems.},

	abstract = {In polygynous mammals, high-quality females may increase their fitness by providing superior care to their offspring. Based on the agonistic interactions of female reindeer in an experimental herd during two consecutive years (1997 and 1998), we tested whether maternal social rank influenced: (1) winter body-mass change of females, (2) preparturition reproductive effort (measured as fecundity, the birth mass and the birth date of their calves), (3) preweaning maternal effort (measured as calves’ preweaning mortality, early preweaning and late preweaning growth rate and September body mass of calves), and (4) postweaning maternal effort (measured as calves’ body-mass change during their first winter). In the models, we included September females’ body mass as a covariate to separate the effects of maternal rank and body mass. We also tested whether the effect of social rank on maternal efforts was dependent on offspring sex. High-ranked females gained body mass whereas low-ranked females lost weight during the winter. Fecundity was higher and date of birth was earlier in high-ranked females than in subordinates, whereas no effect of females’ rank on birth mass of calves was found. Early preweaning growth rate and September body mass of calves increased with increasing females’ social rank, whereas late preweaning daily growth rate of calves was not influenced by females’ rank. Calves’ preweaning mortality was only influenced by year, which also explained most of the variance in the winter body-mass change of calves. The effects of females’ rank on the reproductive-efforts parameters studied were not specific to offspring sex. These findings suggest that females’ rank influences reproductive effort during the preparturition, as well as the preweaning, period, the effect being sex independent.},

We ask what drives seasonal variation in florivory rates: flower quality and abundance or fluctuations in fruit and invertebrate abundances. We explore how capuchins affect the reproductive success of flower food species by quantifying the potential pollination rate. Materials and Methods We followed capuchin groups from dawn to dusk and recorded all flower foraging bouts. Flower food nutritional composition was compared to fruit and invertebrate foods. We recorded overall flower, fruit, and invertebrate abundances and compared the rate of flower foraging to these. We estimated the likelihood of pollination from the proportion of flower patch visits to each plant species that satisfied minimum behavioral requirements. Results Flower eating was highly seasonal, and was significantly negatively related to overall fruit and invertebrate abundance but not flower abundance. Although smaller than most fruits, flowers were nutritionally comparable to fruit foods by dry mass and contained higher average concentrations of protein. Capuchins are likely pollinators for Luehea speciosa; most foraging visits to this species occurred in a manner that makes outcrossing or geitonogamous pollination likely. Discussion Flowers are an important seasonal resource for capuchins. Flowers likely act as fallback foods during periods of reduced fruit and invertebrate abundance, and may exert evolutionary pressure disproportionate to their consumption. Capuchin florivory likely affects the reproductive success of some plants, potentially shaping forest structure. Our study illustrates the value of assessing the importance of rare foods in the primate diet.},

	abstract = {Sexual selection acts to increase the success of males possessing advantageous traits in competition over females. In primates, interspecific variability in social and mating systems creates highly variable selective pressures on males, changing the relative strength of both intra- and intersexual selection, and the relative degree of direct vs. indirect male–male competition. Rhesus macaques are an interesting species for studying intrasexual selection and male–male competition, because they exhibit relatively low (for Papionini) body and canine size dimorphism, and exhibit large testes, suggesting reduced direct competition and strong indirect competition. We have undertaken several studies of male rhesus macaques on Cayo Santiago, from analyses of long-term life-history data to shorter term projects that combined noninvasive measures of physiological markers such as concentrations of urinary C-peptide of insulin and androgen and glucocorticoid (GC) concentrations, with measures of behavior and of sexually selected signals (male red facial coloration). We here review these studies, combining data from short-term studies with long-term mortality data to present an integrated picture of both the short- and long-term gross costs of male mating competition. We find that males exhibit many signs of the costs of indirect competition, such as energetic consequences of reduced feeding and high copulation rates. During periods of more direct contest, such as during dominance instability, males are also characterized by high androgen and GC concentrations among high-ranking individuals. Consistent with relatively weak direct male–male competition, male red skin coloration appears to be more related to female choice (intersexual selection) than the signaling of dominance status (intrasexual selection). Forty-five years of life-history data show that male mortality is higher during the mating than the birth season, a pattern we hypothesize to be linked to the costs associated with mating activity. We finish by discussing unresolved issues, such as the costs of sperm competition and the data that are needed to address them.},

	abstract = {In many animal species, males engage in endurance rivalry, competing for mating opportunites over extended durations. In the rhesus macaque, a seasonally breeding primate species, energetically costly mating behaviours such as consortship lead to greater reproductive success, and the ability of males to improve their body condition before the mating season may be crucial in determining their ability to use such strategies. Here, we explore relationships between male dominance rank, behaviour, body mass index (BMI) and energetics (assessed through urinary C-peptide of insulin levels, UCPs) in free-ranging rhesus macaques during a 6-month birth season and subsequent 6-month mating season. We analysed measures of general activity, mating behaviours and restlessness, here defined as the rate of change between behaviours. During the birth season, high-ranking males spent more time feeding on high-energy food, were less restless and spent less time travelling than low-ranking males. Restlessness and travelling time were both negatively correlated with male BMI and UCPs. Males in good condition during the birth season were in good condition at the onset of the mating season. During the mating season, high-ranking males participated in more consortships, which were positively correlated with copulatory activity. Copulation was negatively correlated with UCP levels, demonstrating the cost of such mating activities. As a consequence, by the end of the mating season, high-ranking males were in the worst condition. Our results suggest that male rhesus macaques engage in competitive endurance rivalry, and that male condition built during the previous birth season is an integral part of mating success.},

(2) We document the following observations in a population of saddle-back tamarins (Saguinus fuscicollis Spix; Callitrichidae) at the Cocha Cashu Biological Station in Peru's Manu National Park. (3) The availability of both fruits and insects was substantially lower during the annual 4-month dry season (May-September) than at other times of the year.

(5) Three-quarters of twenty-two S. fuscicollis births at this site occurred between November and February, and none occurred between mid-March and mid-August. (6) We suggest that tamarin births at Cocha Cashu are timed such that lactation and weaning occur when food is abundant, because during the period of low food availability, there would be insufficient food to meet the demands of lactation and to serve as easily obtainable weaning foods. In this sort of seasonal environment, tamarins appear to be constrained, by the seasonality of their food supply, from breeding as frequently as they do in captivity.},

However, they have so far been strongly limited by the indirect nature of the available non-invasive tools for the measurement of individual energetic status. The measurement of urinary C-peptide (UCP), which in humans and great apes shows a close link to individual nutritional status, may be a more direct, non-invasive tool for such studies in other primates as well and possibly even in non-primate mammals. Here, we test the suitability of UCPs as markers of nutritional status in non-hominid primates, investigating relationships between UCPs and body-mass-index (BMI), skinfold fatness, and plasma C-peptide levels in captive and free-ranging macaques. We also conducted a food reduction experiment, with daily monitoring of body weight and UCP levels. UCP levels showed significant positive correlations with BMI and skinfold fatness in both captive and free-ranging animals and with plasma C-peptide levels in captive ones. In the feeding experiment, UCP levels were positively correlated with changes in body mass and were significantly lower during food reduction than during re-feeding and the pre-experimental control condition. We conclude that UCPs may be used as reliable biomarkers of body condition and nutritional status in studies of free-ranging catarrhines.

Little is known, however, about the constraints that may limit male mate-guarding choices (the costs of this behavior) and the influence of the females’ quality on male investment in mate-guarding. We aimed to study the effects of female rank, parity status, and male–female social bond strength on the costs of and investment in mate-guarding by males. We carried out our study during two reproductive seasons on three groups of wild long-tailed macaques in Indonesia. We combined behavioral observations on male locomotion and activity with noninvasive measurements of fecal glucocorticoids (fGC). Males spent less time feeding when mate-guarding nulliparous females than when mate-guarding parous females and tended to have higher fGC levels when mate-guarding low-ranking nulliparous females than when mate-guarding high-ranking nulliparous ones. Evolution should thus favor male choice for high-ranking parous females because such a decision brings benefits at proximate (reduced costs of mate-guarding) and ultimate (higher reproductive value) levels. Further, male investment in mate-guarding was flexible and contingent on female reproductive and social value. Males were more vigilant and more aggressive toward other males when mate-guarding females to which they were strongly bonded and/or high-ranking ones than when mate-guarding other females. Our findings bring a new dimension to the study of mate choice by showing that males not only mate preferentially with high-quality females but may also aim to secure paternity with these females through optimized monopolization.},

	abstract = {In recent years methodological improvements have allowed for more precise estimates of nutrient intake in wild primates. However, estimates of energetic condition have remained relatively imprecise due to the difficulties of estimating digestive efficiency and energy expenditure in these animals. In the absence of a reliable intake-expenditure calculation, a method is needed that directly links changes in energetic condition, such as body mass, to physiological changes that can be detected via markers in body excretions such as urine or feces. One promising marker is C-peptide, a metabolic byproduct of insulin synthesis. Here we present the results of a food restriction experiment carried out in a group of captive bonobos (Pan paniscus). We measured changes in food availability and body mass and determined urinary C-peptide levels with the help of a time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay routinely used for measuring C-peptide in human blood. Urinary C-peptide levels decreased during a period of food restriction and increased again when food availability was continuously increased. During this refeeding phase an increase in body mass was significantly correlated with an increase in urinary C-peptide levels. Our results suggest that urinary C-peptide levels are an accurate indicator of individual energy balance. In conclusion, measuring C-peptide in urine is a promising method to quantify the energetic condition of wild apes.},

We developed and calibrated indices of nutritional condition for live and dead Rocky Mountain elk. Live-animal indices included 20 serum and 7 urine chemistry variables, a body-condition score (BCS), thickness of subcutaneous fat and selected muscles using ultrasonography, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and body mass. Dead-animal indices included femur and mandible marrow fat, 3 kidney fat indices, and 2 carcass-scoring methods. Forty-three captive-raised cows (1.5 to 7 years old) were randomly divided into 3 seasonal groups (Sep, Dec, and Mar). Within seasonal groups, elk were fed different diets to induce a wide range of condition; all were fed identical diets 7 days prior to sampling to eliminate short-term nutritional effects. Cows were euthanized and homogenized for chemical analysis of fat, protein, water, and ash content. Estimates of fat and gross energy (GE) were compared to each condition indicator using regression, with age and season as covariates. Relations between condition and thyroxine (T4) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) varied seasonally, and the relation between condition and mandible marrow fat varied among ages. Subcutaneous fat depth and BCS were most related to condition for live animals (r2 ≥ 0.87, P {\textless} 0.001); carcass scores and kidney fat were most related to fat and GE for dead animals (r2 ≥ 0.77, P {\textless} 0.001); and IGF-1 and T4 were the only serum and urine indices at least moderately related to condition (r2 ≥ 0.54, P {\textless} 0.001). Nearly all other serum and urine indices, bone marrow indices, and BIA were either poorly correlated with condition or exhibited highly nonlinear relations. These results identify several indices of condition useful for assessing nutritional condition of live or dead elk, and indicate a number of previously used techniques that correlate poorly with total body fat.]},

A growing body of evidence suggests that both home range attributes and biological interpretations of the home range may depend fundamentally on the scale of analysis. We utilize a multiscale mixed effects modelling framework to examine how seasonal fluctuations in climate, food resource abundance and group mass affect variance in home range area and the maturity stage of forest used by a group-living Neotropical primate, the white-faced capuchin, Cebus capucinus. Using an 8-year data set representing over 20 000 contact hours, we estimated home ranges for seven social groups at four nested temporal scales and three nested spatial scales using a movement-based kernel method. Group mass was consistently the most important predictor of home range size in our models, and its effects were relatively insensitive to spatial or temporal scale. Mean daily maximum temperature was an influential factor in shaping monthly range area and composition, with hotter weather favouring smaller home range size and increased use of mature evergreen forest. Greater fruit availability was also associated with smaller monthly range area. The effects of temperature and fruit availability were both scale dependent: the impact of both variables was greatest on the core zone. The different study groups showed marked variation in the habitat composition of their home ranges, but in all groups, higher-use zones consisted of older, more evergreen forest. Our study illustrates the complex ecological processes that affect movement behaviour in a Neotropical primate across a range of spatial and temporal scales, highlighting the importance of group mass, climatic seasonality, landscape heterogeneity and dietary shifts in shaping the home range.},

Assessing variation in physical condition can help identify factors affecting reproductive success, but noninvasive measurement is difficult in wild animals. Creatinine concentration relative to the specific gravity (i.e., density) of urine has promise for noninvasively quantifying the relative muscle mass (RMM) of wild primates. We verified the relationship between these urinary parameters for wild white?faced capuchin monkeys, and assessed temporal changes in the RMM of females across groups and between periods of high and low resource abundance. Materials and Methods We collected urine from 25 adult females in three groups across varying seasons at Sector Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. We measured the specific gravity and creatinine concentration of 692 samples and the effect of specific gravity on creatinine concentration. We used the residuals of this relationship to measure effects of group and season using mixed?effects models. Results Specific gravity significantly predicted creatinine concentration. Season, group membership and the interaction between these variables were significant predictors of residual creatinine variation. Specifically, RMM was higher during months with high fruit energy density, lower in one social group, and less variable among females in the smallest group. Discussion Our findings suggest that specific gravity and creatinine may be used as urinary parameters to make inferences about the RMM of capuchins. Using this technique, we infer that females experienced changes in muscle mass according to variation in resource energy availability and social group variation.},

	abstract = {Background Although habitat use reflects a dynamic process, most studies assess habitat use statically as if an animal's successively recorded locations reflected a point rather than a movement process. By relying on the activity time between successive locations instead of the local density of individual locations, movement-based methods can substantially improve the biological relevance of utilization distribution (UD) estimates (i.e. the relative frequencies with which an animal uses the various areas of its home range, HR). One such method rests on Brownian bridges (BBs). Its theoretical foundation (purely and constantly diffusive movements) is paradoxically inconsistent with both HR settlement and habitat selection. An alternative involves movement-based kernel density estimation (MKDE) through location interpolation, which may be applied to various movement behaviours but lacks a sound theoretical basis. Methodology/Principal Findings I introduce the concept of a biased random (advective-diffusive) bridge (BRB) and show that the MKDE method is a practical means to estimate UDs based on simplified (isotropically diffusive) BRBs. The equation governing BRBs is constrained by the maximum delay between successive relocations warranting constant within-bridge advection (allowed to vary between bridges) but remains otherwise similar to the BB equation. Despite its theoretical inconsistencies, the BB method can therefore be applied to animals that regularly reorientate within their HRs and adapt their movements to the habitats crossed, provided that they were relocated with a high enough frequency. Conclusions/Significance Biased random walks can approximate various movement types at short times from a given relocation. Their simplified form constitutes an effective trade-off between too simple, unrealistic movement models, such as Brownian motion, and more sophisticated and realistic ones, such as biased correlated random walks (BCRWs), which are too complex to yield functional bridges. Relying on simplified BRBs proves to be the most reliable and easily usable way to estimate UDs from serially correlated relocations and raw activity information.},

	volume = {97},
	issn = {0005-7959},
	url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/4534521},
	abstract = {We spent two winters studying the social behaviour of wild woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) at a time when their main food (ground lichens; Cladina sp.) is available only at snow craters dug by the animals. The competition for access to such craters was severe, the animals constantly trying to take over the craters of others. During a two-month period when a group maintained a constant size (20) and composition (all age-sex classes represented), we could rank the animals in a rather linear dominance hierarchy (Landau's index = 0.87). Rank was correlated with access to resources, percent of time spent active, and percent of time feeding in craters. It was also correlated with age and antler size. However, rank is not an attribute of individuals, but of a relationship between individuals. As such it is only an intervening variable between physical attributes and access to resources, a variable whose value has meaning only within a given group. Among the three attributes studied (age, sex, antler size), the latter was by far the best predictor of the occurrence and outcome of interactions. Between two individuals within any of the three age-sex classes studied (adult and yearling males and adult females), the one with larger antlers initiated significantly more often, escalated its aggression (to the point of hitting the target) less often, and enjoyed a higher success rate in obtaining resources. When their antlers were larger than those of an adult male target (i.e. males that had shed their antlers), adult females won almost all their interactions with adult males even though they escalated only one fourth of them. This clarifies the long-standing speculation that female caribou have antlers and shed them later than males, in order to overcome their sexual handicap in competition for food in the winter. We conclude that the link between rank and dominance of an individual on one hand, and some of its attributes on the other (e.g. sex, age, weight, antler size) is fundamentally realized by the animal itself through its active preference for targets it is likely to beat, i.e. targets with smaller antlers. /// Au cours de deux hivers, nous avons étudié le comportement social du caribou des bois (Rangifer tarandus caribou) en nature. C'est un moment de l'année où leur nourriture principale, les lichens terrestres (Cladina sp.), n'est disponible qu'au fond des cratères creusés dans la neige par les animaux. La compétition pour l'accès à la nourriture est très intense autour de ces cratères. Un groupe de 20 caribous comprenant toutes les classes d'âge et de sexe a conservé une grosseur et une composition constante pendant deux mois. Ceci nous a permis de classer les individus selon une hiérarchie de dominance, qui s'est avérée être fortement linéaire (indice de Landau de 0.87). Le rang des individus était corrélé à l'accès aux ressources, au pourcentage du temps actif et au pourcentage du temps passé à se nourrir dans les cratères. Le rang était également corrélé avec l'âge et la grosseur relative des bois des individus. Il est cependant essentiel de noter que le rang n'est pas un caractère d'un individu mais d'une relation entre individus. De plus, ce n'est qu'une variable intermédiaire (ni dépendante ni indépendante) entre de tels caractères physiques et l'accès aux ressources. Parmi les trois caractères étudiés (l'âge, le sexe, et la grosseur des bois), ce dernier était de loin le plus utile pour prédire la production et le résultat d'interactions. Parmi deux individus d'une même classe parmi les trois que nous avons étudiées (mâles et femelles adultes, et hères), celui portant les plus grands bois était significativement plus souvent l'initiateur de l'interaction,il devait escalader son approche (au point de frapper la cible) moins souvent, et son succès à obtenir la ressource contestée était plus élevé. Les femelles adultes dont les bois étaient plus grands que ceux des mâles adultes avec qui elles initiaient une interaction, gagnaient presque toujours leurs interactions et ce même si elles en escaladaient seulement le quart. Ceci démontre avec conviction la supposition répandue voulant que la fonction des bois chez les femelles caribou et la raison pour laquelle elles les perdent beaucoup plus tard que les mâles, soit de contrer leur handicap sexuel dans la compétition pour la nourriture en hiver. Nous concluons que le lien généralement supposé entre la dominance et le rang, d'une part, et certaine des ses caractères d'autre part (e.g. le sexe, l'âge, le poids corporel, la grandeur des bois) est fondamentalement réalisé par l'animal lui-même en choisissant comme cible de ses interactions des congénères qu'il est susceptible de vaincre, i.e. les congénères dont les bois sont plus petits.},

This behaviour is outwardly similar to scent marking in other mammals, but it differs in that the urine is applied to the bare skin of the hands and feet rather than rubbed into the fur or applied directly onto an object in the environment. Empirical evidence for the functional significance of urine-washing remains inconsistent. We used rigorous statistical methods to examine environmental and social influences on urine-washing behaviour, using 4380 observation hours on five groups of wild white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) in Costa Rica. Urine-washing frequencies were most strongly affected by environmental dryness, both within and between seasons, with markedly less urine-washing during humid conditions. Increased individual activity levels also promoted urine-washing. Among females, urine-washing was less frequent during lactation than during pregnancy and other reproductive states. Among males, urine-washing frequencies were greater in alpha males, who also exhibited a 'vigorous' form of urine-washing that may be functionally distinct. During the dry season, 3/5 groups exhibited more urine-washing than expected near fruit trees, but across groups there were no consistent spatial patterns for urine-washing with respect to water resources, home range overlap zones, core areas, inter-group encounter zones, and the home-range periphery. Urine-washing appears to differ fundamentally from common forms of mammalian scent marking. We suggest that its function is primarily mechanical, perhaps to apply a sticky residue to the hands and feet to improve grip on dry, arboreal substrates. Lesser signalling functions may include sexual signalling and resource labelling.]},

Measuring condition of live animals is typically done by regressing body mass on measures of body size and using the residuals as an index of condition. The validity of this condition index was evaluated by determining whether it reflected measured fat content of five species of small mammals (yellow-pine chipmunks (Tamias amoenus Allen), bushy-tailed wood rats (Neotoma cinerea Ord), deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus Ord), red-backed voles (Clethrionomys gapperi Vigors), and meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus Ord)). We also determined whether body water could predict fat content, enabling the use of hydrogen-isotope dilution for estimating condition. For all five species, condition estimates weakly predicted fat content and more accurately predicted variation in lean dry mass and water content. The relationship between body water and fat content was inconsistent among the five species, discouraging against the general use of isot..., La condition physique (réserves énergétiques) peut avoir une influence importante sur le fitness.

Since parasites harm their hosts, ecologists might expect negative relationships between infection and condition in wildlife, but this assumption is challenged by studies showing positive or null condition–infection relationships. Here, we outline common condition metrics used by ecologists in studies of parasitism, and consider mechanisms that cause negative, positive, and null condition–infection relationships in wildlife systems. We then perform a meta-analysis of 553 condition–infection relationships from 187 peer-reviewed studies of animal hosts, analysing observational and experimental records separately, and noting whether authors measured binary infection status or intensity. Our analysis finds substantial heterogeneity in the strength and direction of condition–infection relationships, a small, negative average effect size that is stronger in experimental studies, and evidence for publication bias towards negative relationships. The strongest predictors of variation in study outcomes are host thermoregulation and the methods used to evaluate body condition. We recommend that studies aiming to assess parasite impacts on body condition should consider host–parasite biology, choose condition measures that can change during the course of infection, and employ longitudinal surveys or manipulate infection status when feasible.},

Eight animals were randomly divided into two experimental groups fed isocaloric diets: Group H ate Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) throughout the experiment while Group P was switched to walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) during a 28-day food restriction (after a 28-day baseline) and back to herring during a 28-day controlled re-feeding. Diet type did not impact the rates of body mass lost when food was restricted, but did influence the type of internal energy reserve (protein vs. lipids) the sea lions predominantly used. In both summer and winter, Group H lost significantly more lipids and less lean mass than Group P that was fed pollock during the restriction phase. The response of Group H was consistent with the predicted pattern of nutritional stress physiology (i.e. protein sparing and utilization of lipid reserves). Group P lost a surprisingly high proportion of body protein while consuming restricted levels of pollock, which could lead to muscle impairment and vital organ failure on a long-term basis. When given increased amounts of herring during the controlled re-feeding phase, the capacity of both groups to compensate for the previous mass loss was found to depend on season and was independent of previous diet. All of the sea lions increased their rates of mass gain and returned to their pre-experimental weight during winter, but not during summer. Some intrinsic energetic plasticity related to seasonal adaptation to the environment may render winter an easier period than summer to recover from nutritional stress.},

	abstract = {For social species, the environment has two components: physical and social. The social environment modifies the individual's interaction with the physical environment, and the physical environment may in turn impact individuals’ social relationships. This interplay can generate considerable variation among individuals in survival and reproduction. Here, I synthesize more than four decades of research on the baboons of the Amboseli basin in southern Kenya to illustrate how social and physical environments interact to affect reproduction and survival. For immature baboons, social behaviour can both mitigate and exacerbate the challenge of survival. Only c. 50\% of live-born females and c. 44\% of live-born males reach the median age of first reproduction. Variation in pre-adult survival, growth and development is associated with multiple aspects of the social environment. For instance, conspecifics provide direct care and are a major source of social knowledge about food and the environment, but conspecifics can also represent a direct threat to survival through infanticide. In adulthood, both competition (within and between social groups) and cooperative affiliation (i.e. collective action and/or the exchange of social resources such as grooming) are prominent features of baboon social life and have important consequences for reproduction and survival. For instance, adult females with higher social dominance ranks have accelerated reproduction, and adult females that engage in more frequent affiliative social interactions have higher survival throughout adulthood. The early life environment also has important consequences for adult reproduction and survival, as in a number of other bird and mammal species. In seasonal breeders, early life effects often apply to entire cohorts; in contrast, in nonseasonal and highly social species such as baboons, early life effects are more individual-specific, stemming from considerable variation not only in the early physical environment (even if they are born in the same year) but also in the particulars of their social environment.},

We found that small, isolated patches are inordinately important for biodiversity conservation. Our results provide a powerful argument for redressing the neglect of small, isolated habitat patches, for urgently prioritizing their restoration, and for avoiding simplistic application of island biogeography theory in conservation decisions.},

	abstract = {Male mammals employ a wide variety of mating strategies in order to increase their reproductive success, which in turn influence their social behavior. In some populations of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.), males cooperate in small groups or alliances to gain access to females for mating. However, the occurrence of these male cooperative groups has been predicted to occur only under certain social and ecological conditions, driven by factors such as differences in population density, operational sex ratio, and sexual size dimorphism. Here, we used generalized affiliation indices, social network techniques, and maternally and bi-parentally inherited genetic markers to investigate the affiliation patterns and genetic relatedness among male southern Australian bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops cf. australis) in a small embayment in South Australia. Photo-identification data and biopsy samples were collected in Coffin Bay from 2013 to 2015 through systematic boat-based surveys. We found that highly sighted male dolphins formed 12 social clusters composed of two to five individuals. Genetic analyses revealed that general male affiliation patterns were significantly correlated with mtDNA haplotype sharing. In addition, preferred affiliates showed significantly higher levels of genetic relatedness compared to casual and avoided male pairs. Our results corroborate theoretical expectations for the formation of social bonds in small delphinids and suggest that a high density of dolphins, with an expected skewed operational sex ratio and no apparent sexual size dimorphism, is likely to have favored the formation of strong male affiliations. In addition, the availability of genetic relatives within the population may have favored male affiliations based on kinship relationships.Significance statementMale bottlenose dolphins use different strategies to gain access to females, from single roving individuals, pairs or trios in alliances, to stable mixed-sex groups. Moreover, the role of kinship in the formation of male social bonds also varies within and among populations. This variability has been attributed to differences in ecological and intrinsic factors. Here, we studied the affiliation patterns and genetic relatedness in southern Australian bottlenose dolphins and demonstrated that kinship plays an important role in the formation of close male social ties. Furthermore, the results corroborate previous findings about the factors that contribute to the formation of male social bonds in these animals.},

Although predictions rest on the well-advanced theory of age-structured populations, two key issues remain poorly explored. Specifically, how the age-dependency in demographic rates and the year-to-year interactions between survival and fecundity affect stochastic population growth rates. We use inference, simulations and mathematical derivations to explore how environmental perturbations determine population growth rates for populations with different age-specific demographic rates and when ages are reduced to stages. We find that stage- vs. age-based models can produce markedly divergent stochastic population growth rates. The differences are most pronounced when there are survival-fecundity-trade-offs, which reduce the variance in the population growth rate. Finally, the expected value and variance of the stochastic growth rates of populations with different age-specific demographic rates can diverge to the extent that, while some populations may thrive, others will inevitably go extinct.},

Comparative data on demographic changes in two isolated populations of the northern muriqui (Brachyteles hypoxanthus) during a severe yellow fever outbreak in southeastern Brazil provide unique insights into the potential effects of this disease in this Critically Endangered species. From October 2016 to April 2017, the muriqui population at the Reserva Particular do Patrimônio Natural—Feliciano Miguel Abdala (Caratinga) lost 31 of its 324 members, or nearly 10\%, whereas the population at the Reserva Particular do Patrimônio Natural—Mata do Sossego (Sossego) declined from 34 to 25 individuals, or 26\%. Greater per-capita risks to muriquis in the Sossego population could be related to ecological and anthropogenic differences, including a wetter climate and an absence of sympatric howler monkeys (Alouatta guariba), which may have directly or indirectly buffered the Caratinga muriquis. Although we lack definitive confirmation that the muriqui population declines were caused by yellow fever, the timing and magnitude of the losses strongly implicate the disease. We highlight the risks of catastrophic population declines in small populations and emphasize the value of long-term demographic monitoring studies.},

	abstract = {The dynamic nature of animal societies often hides multiple layers of complexity. The field of animal behaviour is rapidly advancing with the development of increasingly sophisticated analytical methods that allow scientists to identify complex and nuanced drivers of social patterns. The resurgent interest in giraffe sociality illustrates this by challenging the early view that individuals interact at random; it became clear that, instead, giraffes can be organized into multilevel societies, apparently founded on preferred associations. However, it is unclear whether such enduring associations result from active choice for specific individuals. The extent to which other social and asocial factors can contribute to an individual's inclusion in groups remains underexplored. Here we assess how context affects social preferences at the individual level by evaluating grouping patterns of giraffes in different behavioural states, habitats and levels of disturbance. When we controlled for potential class-based (as opposed to individual-based) assortment of individuals by sex, age and gregariousness, we found that giraffes only exhibited individual social preferences when foraging, with minor influence of habitat complexity or level of disturbance.

As a result, theoretical and empirical contact network models of infectious disease spread are increasingly providing valuable insights into wildlife epidemiology. Analyzing an exceptionally detailed dataset on contact structure within a high-density population of European badgers Meles meles, we show that a modular contact network produced by spatially structured stable social groups, lead to smaller epidemics, particularly for infections with intermediate transmissibility. The key advance is that we identify considerable variation among individuals in their role in disease spread, with these new insights made possible by the detail in the badger dataset. Furthermore, the important impacts on epidemiology are found even though the modularity of the Badger network is much lower than the threshold that previous work suggested was necessary. These findings reveal the importance of stable social group structure for disease dynamics with important management implications for socially structured populations.},

	abstract = {Animals can play important roles in structuring the plant communities in which they live. Some species are particularly influential in that they modify the physical environment by changing, maintaining, and/or creating new habitats; the term ecosystem engineer has been used to describe such species. We here assess the two major foraging strategies of primates, frugivory and folivory, in terms of the potential for primates to function as ecosystem engineers. We argue that whereas the role of primates as seed dispersers has received a great deal of attention, the potential role that folivorous primates play in structuring their environment through herbivory has received much less attention. Further, while quantifying if frugivorous primates are ecosystem engineers through their seed dispersal has proved very difficult, it is not as difficult to ascertain whether folivorous primates are ecosystem engineers. We document situations in which folivorous primates act as ecosystem engineers by 1) eating the leaves and/or bark of trees to the extent that they kill trees, 2) feeding on trees to the degree that they slow their growth relative to nonpreferred tree species, 3) eating the flowers of species to the extent that it does not set fruit, or 4) feeding on plants in such a way as to increase their productivity and abundance. Because evidence from the literature is very limited, where possible we present new evidence of these processes from the colobus monkeys at our long-term field site in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We conclude by discussing promising research programs that could be established to refine our understanding of the role primates play in shaping the structure of plant communities, especially tropical forests.},

Consequently, primates have long been thought to be important seed dispersers. It is only recently that studies have been conducted that have illustrated the complex nature of the interactions between fruit-eating primates and their food trees. Such studies have raised questions as to the causes and conse-quences of the intriguing differences between primate communities, the importance of other animals in the interactions (such as dung beetles and rodents that secon-darily disperse seeds), how primate-plant interactions evolve, and the significance of primates in forest regeneration and conservation. Since subsistence and com-mercial hunting of primates has heavily impacted frugivore communities, but left the physical structure of the forest relatively unaltered, studies of primate seed dispersal have important implications for the future of forests where seed dispersers have declined or disappeared.},

	abstract = {Cebus capucinus has converged with Old World monkeys by having strong, long-term social bonds among related females that are characterized by linear dominance hierarchies, frequent grooming, and coalition formation, biased toward maternal kin. Males also maintain long-term relationships with kin, by comigrating with close male relatives. Males need male allies to take over groups with mature females. The alpha male sires virtually all offspring born to females who are not his direct descendants. Thus, the males who assist the alpha male in gaining and preserving access to breeding females typically must delay breeding until the alpha male's daughters have matured. Infanticide by alpha males is the primary cause of infant death. Females support the current alpha male, thereby preventing disruptive takeovers that could result in infanticide. Some alpha males maintain their position for up to 18years. Under such conditions, survival rates and the average degree of relatedness within a group are high. High male reproductive skew, frequent coalitionary lethal aggression, and infanticide put selective pressures on both males and females to engage in coalition formation. The rich repertoire of stereotyped recruitment signals suggests a long evolutionary history of coalition formation. The unusual diversity of traditional dyadic social conventions in this species may also be a consequence of selection for ability to test the quality of social bonds.},

We evaluated a 15-year dataset of tree phenology in Kibale National Park, Uganda, to identify abiotic predictors of fruit phenological patterns and discuss our findings in light of climate change. We quantified fruiting for 326 trees from 43 species and evaluated these patterns in relation to solar radiance, rainfall, and monthly temperature. We used time-lagged variables based on seasonality in linear regression models to assess the effect of abiotic variables on the proportion of fruiting trees. Annual fruiting varied over 3.8-fold, and inter-annual variation in fruiting is associated with the extent of fruiting in the peak period, not variation in time of fruit set. While temperature and rainfall showed positive effects on fruiting, solar radiance in the two-year period encompassing a given year and the previous year was the strongest predictor of fruiting. As solar irradiance was the strongest predictor of fruiting, the projected increase in rainfall associated with climate change, and coincident increase in cloud cover suggest that climate change will lead to a decrease in fruiting. ENSO in the prior 24-month period was also significantly associated with annual ripe fruit production, and ENSO is also affected by climate change. Predicting changes in phenology demands understanding inter-annual variation in fruit dynamics in light of potential abiotic drivers, patterns that will only emerge with long-term data.},

Recently, Barr, Levy, Scheepers, and Tily, 2013 recommended fitting `maximal' models with all possible random effect components included. Estimation of maximal models, however, may not converge. We show that failure to converge typically is not due to a suboptimal estimation algorithm, but is a consequence of attempting to fit a model that is too complex to be properly supported by the data, irrespective of whether estimation is based on maximum likelihood or on Bayesian hierarchical modeling with uninformative or weakly informative priors. Importantly, even under convergence, overparameterization may lead to uninterpretable models. We provide diagnostic tools for detecting overparameterization and guiding model simplification.},

The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

Changing social environments can influence this decision-making process by constraining choice or altering the likelihood of a positive outcome. Here, we conceptualized grooming as a choice situation where an individual chooses one of a number of potential partners. Studying two wild populations of sympatric primate species, sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys atys) and western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus), we tested what properties of potential partners influenced grooming decisions, including their relative value based on available alternatives and the social relationships of potential partners with bystanders who could observe the outcome of the decision. Across 1529 decision events, multiple partner attributes (e.g. dominance ranks, social relationship quality, reproductive state, partner sex) influenced choice. Individuals preferred to initiate grooming with partners of similar global rank, but this effect was driven by a bias towards partners with a high rank compared to other locally available options. Individuals also avoided grooming partners who had strong social relationships with at least one bystander. Results indicated flexible decision-making in grooming interactions in both species, based on a partner's value given the local social environment. Viewing partner choice as a value-based decision-making process allows researchers to compare how different species solve similar social problems.},

We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations.

	url = {https://prism.ucalgary.ca/handle/11023/1647},
	abstract = {As global change accelerates, there is a growing imperative to understand how wild animals respond to changing environments. I investigated how environmental variability, both in the short term (seasonality and habitat differences) and the long term (changing climate and habitats), shapes the behavioral ecology of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) in a highly seasonal dry forest mosaic in Costa Rica. I used a multi-scale approach with the ultimate goal of gaining a more complete understanding of how individual-level selective pressures scale up over space and time to affect group and population dynamics. Perceived predation risk, based on alarm-call responses to distinct predator classes, varied among habitat types and was greatest in mature forest. The capuchins adjusted their anti-predator vigilance behavior to changing levels of perceived risk. Feeding efficiency varied over both space and time and was greatest during the wet season and in mature forest habitats, which were both associated with higher energy intake rates and lower energy expenditure rates. The hot dry season also favored smaller home ranges, with high-use zones concentrated around patches of mature evergreen forest. These findings demonstrate that environmental variability plays a key role in driving the spatial ecology of capuchin individuals and groups. Because the dry season is associated with greater energetic deficits, the capuchins' increased preference for mature forest and more compact use of space during the dry season may be a behavioral adjustment aimed at maximizing use of the most productive foraging areas and reducing travel, perhaps at the expense of safety. Finally, I examined spatial and demographic patterns in the growing capuchin population over multiple decades in relation to quantitative information on how the environment changed over the same period. The availability of evergreen habitats varied with the strength of the previous wet season, which in turn was strongly coupled with global climatic and oceanic cycles. Following extreme drought periods, population growth slowed, mean group size decreased, and reproductive rate declined. Future work will aim to develop a deeper understanding of how climate change will affect primate populations and to expand the scope and generality of this research to a global scale.},

For social species, this is complicated because potential stressors may come from the physical environment, social environment, or some combination of both, while the stress response itself is generalized. Here, we present a multivariate examination of urinary cortisol dynamics over 6years in the lives of wild female chimpanzees in the Kanyawara community of Kibale National Park, Uganda. We hypothesized that chimpanzee socioecology provides strong indications of both energetic and social stress to females, but that the salience of these stressors might vary over a female's life history in accordance with their changing reproductive costs and social interactions. Using linear mixed models, we found that urinary cortisol levels increased significantly with age but were also elevated in young immigrants to the community. Across reproductive states, cycling, non-estrous females had relatively low cortisol compared to lactating, estrous, or pregnant females. Aggression from males led to higher cortisol levels among estrous females, frequent targets of aggressive sexual coercion. In contrast, energetic stress was most salient to lactating females, who experienced higher cortisol during months of low fruit consumption. Low dominance rank was associated with increased cortisol, particularly during the energetically demanding period of lactation. The effects of female conflict were felt widely, even among those who were the primary aggressors, providing further evidence that long-term resource competition, while apparently muted, exerts a far-reaching impact on the lives of chimpanzee females.},

	abstract = {Ketone bodies are produced by the liver and used peripherally as an energy source when glucose is not readily available. The two main ketone bodies are acetoacetate (AcAc) and 3-β-hydroxybutyrate (3HB), while acetone is the third, and least abundant, ketone body. Ketones are always present in the blood and their levels increase during fasting and prolonged exercise. They are also found in the blood of neonates and pregnant women. Diabetes is the most common pathological cause of elevated blood ketones. In diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), high levels of ketones are produced in response to low insulin levels and high levels of counterregulatory hormones. In acute DKA, the ketone body ratio (3HB:AcAc) rises from normal (1:1) to as high as 10:1. In response to insulin therapy, 3HB levels commonly decrease long before AcAc levels. The frequently employed nitroprusside test only detects AcAc in blood and urine. This test is inconvenient, does not assess the best indicator of ketone body levels (3HB), provides only a semiquantitative assessment of ketone levels and is associated with false-positive results. Recently, inexpensive quantitative tests of 3HB levels have become available for use with small blood samples (5–25 µl). These tests offer new options for monitoring and treating diabetes and other states characterized by the abnormal metabolism of ketone bodies. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Ratings are based on observers' judgments of degree of overall obesity of individual monkeys. The procedure was tested separately on samples of males and females over 2 successive years. Within each of these four samples, observers' judgments were both highly reliable and highly correlated with actual measures of body weight and with estimates of body fat based on morphometric measures, including the Quetelet index. To test the degree to which scores from different applications of the scale could be compared with one another, regression functions were calculated for scale vs. the Quetelet index and for scale vs. body weight for each application. No significant differences were found among the four regression functions for scale vs. the Quetelet index for fully grown adult monkeys. This suggested that observers' judgment criteria with regard to this measure were sufficiently stable across the four test applications to allow meaningful comparison of scores. Comparable analyses for body weight suggested that observers' judgment criteria were stable over time but not between sexes. These data suggest that observers had been successful in attending more closely to obesity than to body weight. Obesity scales have many potential uses both in the field and in captivity provided they are adequately tested before use.},

	abstract = {The stability of social relationships is important to animals living in groups, and social network analysis provides a powerful tool to help characterize and understand their (in)stability and the consequences at the group level. However, the use of dynamic social networks is still limited in this context as it requires long-term social data and new analytical tools. Here, we study the dynamic evolution of a group of 29 Guinea baboons using a dataset of automatically collected cognitive tests comprising more than 16M records collected over 3 years. We first built a monthly aggregated temporal network describing the baboon's co-presence in the cognitive testing booths. We then used a null model, considering the heterogeneity in the baboons' activity, to define both positive (association) and negative (avoidance) monthly networks. We tested social balance theory by combining these positive and negative social networks. The results showed that the networks were structurally balanced and that newly created edges also tended to preserve social balance. We investigated several network metrics to gain insights into the individual level and group level social networks long-term temporal evolution. A measure of similarity between successive monthly networks was able to pinpoint periods of stability and instability and to show how some baboons' ego-networks remained stable while others changed radically. Our study confirms the prediction of social balance theory but also shows that large fluctuations in the numbers of triads may limit its applicability to study the dynamic evolution of animal social networks. In contrast, the use of the similarity measure proved to be very versatile and sensitive in detecting relationships' (in)stabilities at different levels. The changes we identified can be linked, at least in some cases, to females changing primary male, as observed in the wild.},

	abstract = {This research examines the energy budget of breeding female Antarctic fur seals, both when food was plentiful and when it is scarce. The energy expenditure and change in body mass of lactating female Antartic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, foraging at sea was measured in two years using doubly labeled water at South Georgia Island. There was no difference between years in mass gain, water influx, mass—specific field metabolic rate (FMR), or absolute FMR. Mean at—sea FMR over both years was 9.52 ± 0.55 W/kg (n = 22), a value that is 6.7 times the predicted basal rate but only 1.9 times the FMR measured onshored. Comparable results have been reported for similar—sized northern fur seals. Krill, the nearly exclusive prey of breeding females, were scarce in 1984 at South Georgia. Fur seal foraging trips were twice as long in 1984 as in 1985 and total mass—specific energy expended by females during these trips was significantly greater. In addition, females were significantly lighter at parturition in 1984, and both pup mortality and the proportion of pups that died from starvation were double the 1985 values. Female condition at parturition and average foraging—trip duration (i.e., offspring—provisioning rate) appear to reflect prey availability. The similarity between years in mass increase suggests that females may have a limited ability to increase the relative time spent foraging because even in normal years only 5\% of their time at sea is spent resting. This contrasts with northern fur seals, Callorhinus ursinus, which typically spend 17\% of their time at sea inactive. Apparently these northern seals can increase their foraging effort by increasing the proportion of time spent foraging. This would account for the observed between—year difference in at—sea FMR of C. ursinus while foraging—trip duration remained fairly constant.},

	abstract = {Objectives Invertebrates are important foods for many primates and provide valuable nutrients often unavailable from plant sources. We examine the diet of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus imitator) to determine: (a) timing and types of invertebrate food consumption; (b) whether invertebrate consumption varies with availability of plant foods; and (c) how invertebrates contribute to energy and protein intake of females during different reproductive states. Materials and methods We analyze 2 years of behavioral data from 25 adult female capuchins to determine which invertebrates are eaten. We describe annual and monthly invertebrate consumption patterns, and, employing circular statistics, analyze seasonal consumption of the four most important invertebrate groups eaten. We apply logistic regression analyses to tree density and fruit energy data to determine whether capuchin invertebrate foraging is related to fruit energy availability of their most commonly consumed fruits. We evaluate the nutritional contribution of invertebrates to energetic and protein requirements of females over time and across reproductive stages. Results Capuchins consumed invertebrates from 21 identifiable groups, but their diet was dominated by four orders: Lepidoptera, Orthoptera, Hemiptera, and Hymenoptera. All four orders were consumed in a significantly seasonal pattern, and reduced fruit energy availability was a significant predictor of increased invertebrate foraging. Capuchin females often required invertebrate energy intake to meet their overall monthly energetic needs, particularly while they were lactating, even though they appear to exceed their protein requirements every month. Discussion These results indicate that invertebrate consumption is critical for capuchin energetic needs, particularly during periods of reduced fruit availability and lactation.},

	abstract = {Owl monkeys live in monogamous groups including one pair of adults and a few young. Adult males transport infants, share food and play with them more frequently than do mothers. The intense paternal care may have evolved because it lessens the energetic costs of female reproduction. We evaluated a lab-field approach for quantifying energetics using dependent variables that can be measured only in the lab (C-peptide), or in both lab and field (activity, body mass). We fitted one adult male and one adult female with accelerometer collars that continuously recorded their activity while housed in an 8 m3 cage (3 weeks) or a 2.8 m3 cage (2 weeks). We weighed the subjects at the beginning and end of the study and we collected urine samples three times a week (female=17, male=18). There was more activity in the larger cage, whereas C-peptide levels were higher in the smaller cage (male: 411±269 vs 314±117, female: 863±659 vs 329 ± 141). Individuals gained weight (female: 971 to 1129 gr; male: 713 to 742 gr). The reduced activity in the smaller cage resulted in a positive energy balance as reflected by increased higher C-peptide values and weight gain. A lab-field approach can qualitatively change our understanding of the mechanisms used by male and female owl monkeys to satisfy their energetic demands.},

Cyclical variations were found in the body weight of male polecats from maximum values in February (2.1 kg) to minimum values in June–July (1.5 kg). There were only minor seasonal changes in the body weight of females. There was a direct relationship between body weight and voluntary energy intake on one hand (r=0.89) and an inverse relationship between body weight and locomotor activity (r=−0.88) on the other hand. Energy intake was significantly (p{\textless}0.05) higher during winter (224 kcal/animal/day) than during summer (142 kcal/animal/day). Total time spent outside the nest was at its maximum during the winter months (60 min/day). The results suggest that in male polecats, changes in absolute food intake induce seasonal changes in body weight. Seasonal changes in locomotor activity seem to be less important in energy balance regulation. The fact that the body weight of females showed only minor seasonal variation supports the role of sexual hormones in the control of the body weight.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial mammals with differentiated social relationships live in ‘semi-closed groups’ that occasionally accept new members emigrating from other groups. Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in Shark Bay, Western Australia, exhibit a fission–fusion grouping pattern with strongly differentiated relationships, including nested male alliances. Previous studies failed to detect a group membership ‘boundary’, suggesting that the dolphins live in an open social network. However, two alternative hypotheses have not been excluded. The community defence model posits that the dolphins live in a large semi-closed ‘chimpanzee-like’ community defended by males and predicts that a dominant alliance(s) will range over the entire community range. The mating season defence model predicts that alliances will defend mating-season territories or sets of females. Here, both models are tested and rejected: no alliances ranged over the entire community range and alliances showed extensive overlap in mating season ranges and consorted females. The Shark Bay dolphins, therefore, present a combination of traits that is unique among mammals: complex male alliances in an open social network. The open social network of dolphins is linked to their relatively low costs of locomotion. This reveals a surprising and previously unrecognized convergence between adaptations reducing travel costs and complex intergroup–alliance relationships in dolphins, elephants and humans.},

	abstract = {Large, solitary, marine predators such as sharks have been observed to aggregate at specific areas. Such aggregations are almost certainly driven by foraging and behavioural strategies making space for diverse spatial organizations. Reef-associated shark species often show strong patterns of site fidelity that could be viewed as a prerequisite for sociality. However, there is limited empirical evidence that such aggregations are driven by intrinsic social factors. Association data for blacktip reef sharks, Carcharhinus melanopterus, were obtained from photoidentification surveys conducted in Moorea coral reefs (French Polynesia). We adapted a social network approach to demonstrate evidence of four main communities and two subcommunities within the population. We confronted the resulting structure with candidate explanatory variables. Sharks formed spatial groups characterized by nonrandom and long-term associations, despite opportunities for social relationships to develop between communities. Sex and length of sharks tended to influence assortment at the population and community levels. Individual space use also explained community structure, although spatial assortment was globally weaker than random expectations, suggesting that observed associations were not an artefact of the sampling design or spatial distribution of individuals. We conclude that the observed grouping patterns not only resulted from passive aggregations for specific resources, but rather the communities developed from an active choice of individuals as a sign of sociability.

	abstract = {Defining intra-population community variation in group living mammals provides insights about the impact of environmental, social, and anthropogenic factors on population sub-structuring. Here, we use generalised affiliation indices (GAIs) and social network analysis to investigate social cohesion and intra-population community structure of southern Australian bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) inhabiting Adelaide’s metropolitan coast in South Australia. Information on the sex and site fidelity of photographically identified individuals was used to investigate the potential link between these parameters and preferred affiliations at the population level. Genetic data was also used to investigate genetic relatedness within and between sex and communities. Overall, dolphins showed non-random associations, with preferred associates prominent amongst females and resident individuals. Dolphins were clustered into two social communities that showed little spatial overlap and were associated with different habitats: a northern, shallow-water community (NSWC) and a southern, deep-water community (SDWC). As expected, preferred associations were more prevalent within than between communities, and analyses of genetic relatedness indicated that dolphins, particularly females, were on average more related within than between communities. Social network metrics varied between communities, with the temporal stability of associations for both communities characterised by rapid disassociations and casual acquaintances. We suggest that these two dolphin communities likely arose due to a combination of ecological and socio-genetic factors. This study enhances our understanding of factors shaping social groups in long-lived mammals and our ability to manage human activities that can impact upon their behaviour and social structure.Significance statementDetermining how and why individual animals interact and form groups is important for understanding the evolution of sociality and designing management strategies for wildlife conservation. We investigated association patterns and social community structure in southern Australian bottlenose dolphins in Gulf waters of South Australia. Within the study area, dolphins were divided into two separate communities associated with different habitat types. Within these two communities, dolphins formed groups with particular individuals and mostly related individuals amongst females. These findings enhance our understanding of the factors shaping mammalian groups and our ability to manage human activities that can impact upon their behaviour and social structure.},

Using network analytical tools we investigated fundamental components of social structure in a highly fluid fission–fusion society. We constructed a social network and studied the relative importance of sex and age class, fine-scale site fidelity and male territory distribution in a breeding colony of the Galápagos sealion, Zalophus wollebaeki. The social system was partitioned into a hierarchy with at least three levels. The outermost level of organization was given by a single social network, where all individuals of the population were interconnected. This level split into communities and further into cliques. Sex and age class influenced social structure at the population level, whereas fine-scale site fidelity explained most of the structure found at the community level. None of these assortment variables could account for clique structure, which might therefore be explained in terms of individual preferences, genetic relatedness or a combination of both. Male territories did not form the basic unit of social structure, but appeared simply to be superimposed on the structural backbone formed by females and young.},

Reproductive status can influence female feeding patterns, e.g., lactating females in some primate species consume greater quantities of food and specific nutrients than do nonlactating females. We examined the energy intake, ingestion rate, and composition of the diet in female white-faced capuchins in 3 reproductive states: lactating, gestating, and cycling. We observed 12 reproductively active females for 7 mo and compared their energy intake, ingestion rates, and intake rates of nutrients: protein, fat, sugar, and fiber. Lactating females took in significantly more energy per hour while feeding than pregnant and cycling females did. Lactating females also ingested significantly more food items per hour, but they did not spend more time eating than other females did, and they did not differ in the composition of their diet as measured by insect consumption and proportion of protein. Pregnant and cycling females did not differ from each other in any of the measures. We predicted that as the infants aged and began to move independently to forage and play, their mothers’ energy intake rates would decrease in concert with decreased energy demands by the infant. We found a statistically significant relationship between these 2 factors, with infant age explaining 75.4\% of variation in mothers’ energy intake, supporting previous studies that found lactation to be the most energetically expensive reproductive state.},

	abstract = {Relatively few papers have focused on interbirth intervals in primates, even though the spacing between births is one of the primary determinants of female reproductive success in long-lived mammals. We present life history data from a ten-year field study of Costa Rican capuchins (Cebus capucinus), howlers (Alouatta palliata), and spidei monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi). Analyses of intraspecific variability found no significant differences attributable to individual variation in age, parity, weight, or maternal rank. Loss of an infant significantly shortened the interbirth interval in all three species. There was no correlation between annual rainfall and birth rates, but there was a significant clustering of births in the dry season. Survival analyses demonstrated a significant difference between the median interbirth intervals of the three species. Howlers have the shortest intervals (19.9 months), capuchins exhibit longer intervals (26.36 months), and spider monkeys have the longest intervals (34.72 months;. This comparative pattern does not correspond to relative body weights of the three species, but does correspond to relative brain weights. Comparisons to other primates with similar life history characteristics demonstrate that interbirth intervals are best examined at the level of their three component phases: gestation, lactation, and cycling to re-conception. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Male primates may immigrate into groups by peacefully joining the residents and taking up low-ranking positions in the hierarchy, or they may enter by force, challenging the resident males and attempting to drive them from high rank or from the group. Here we address the questions of how, when, and why immigrating male white-faced capuchins (C. capucinus) at Santa Rosa replace the former resident males of our groups, rather than simply joining them. We present data on 15 male replacements in 6 study groups tracked from 1984 through March 2004. During 11 aggressive takeovers, resident males were nearly always outnumbered by coalitions of invading males; lone resident males were particularly vulnerable. Both residents and invaders were wounded and infants often perished during or soon after takeovers. Male replacements also occur when resident males abandon their groups and males from neighboring groups 'waltz in' to become resident. Three such 'waltz in' replacements occurred during the study period. If we combine takeovers with 'waltz in' cases, replacements occur about every 4 years in our study groups, almost invariably during the dry season months of January to April, about 3-6 months before the annual peak in conceptions. In the years that groups are subject to takeovers, group composition includes significantly lower proportions of adult males than in no-takeover years. We conclude that: (1) the mechanism of male replacement is usually aggressive takeover, but sometimes abandonment of the group by prior resident males occurs; and (2) aggressive takeovers are more likely to happen when the group is vulnerable because it has a lower proportion of adult males, particularly when all co-resident males have emigrated, leaving only the alpha male in residence. Our long-term study shows that adult males need coalition partners not only to gain entry to a group but also to maintain their membership within it.},

	abstract = {The effect of aggressive competition over food resources on energy intake rate is analyzed for individuals of three groups of 25–35 white-faced capuchin monkeys, Cebus capucinus, living in and near Lomas Barbudal Biological Reserve, Costa Rica. An individual’s energy intake rate on a given food species was affected by its rank and the number of agonistic interactions within the feeding tree. Dominant group members had higher energy intake rates relative to subordinate group members whether or not there was agonism within the feeding tree. Low- and mid-ranked individuals had lower energy intake rates in trees with higher amounts of aggression, while energy intake rate of high-ranked individuals was not affected by the amount of aggression in the feeding tree. Energy intake was not influenced by the sex of the individual when rank was held constant statistically. Energy intake was positively correlated with total crown energy (measured in kilojoules) within the feeding tree for two of three study groups. This difference may be explained by the quality of each group’s territory. Finally, high-ranked individuals are responsible for the majority of agonism within feeding trees and target middle- and low-ranked individuals equally. These findings fit the predictions of current socioecological models for within-group contest competition over food resources. The results of this study suggest that within-group competition affects energy intake rate in white-faced capuchin monkeys.},

	abstract = {Research on the gut microbiota of free-ranging mammals is offering new insights into dietary ecology. However, for free-ranging primates, little information is available for how microbiomes are influenced by ecological variation through time. Primates inhabiting seasonal tropical dry forests undergo seasonally specific decreases in food abundance and water availability, which have been linked to adverse health effects. Throughout the course of a seasonal transition in 2014, we collected fecal samples from three social groups of free-ranging white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus imitator) in Sector Santa Rosa, Área de Conservación Guanacaste, Costa Rica. 16S rRNA sequencing data reveal that unlike other primates, the white-faced capuchin monkey gut is dominated by Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus. Linear mixed effects models indicate that abundances of these genera are associated with fluctuating availability and consumption of fruit and arthropods, whereas beta diversity clusters by rainfall season. Whole shotgun metagenomics revealed that the capuchin gut is dominated by carbohydrate-binding modules associated with digestion of plant polysaccharides and chitin, matching seasonal dietary patterns. We conclude that rainfall and diet are associated with the diversity, composition, and function of the capuchin gut microbiome. Additionally, microbial fluctuations are likely contributing to nutrient uptake and the health of wild primate populations.},

Although this flexible lifestyle permits individuals to reduce conflicts of interest, it simultaneously imposes a unique set of challenges on group members that are regularly subject to prolonged separation. Theory predicts animals should evolve ritualized and risky displays to quickly update relationships at reunions. Here we investigated the function of nonconciliatory greetings among adult female spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, belonging to a single, large female-dominated social group in Kenya. We tested three hypotheses forwarded to explain the occurrence of these multimodal signals: formal submission, tension reduction and social bonding hypotheses. In contrast to predictions of the formal submission hypothesis, rank distance and relative rank were excluded from our best model predicting greetings among adult females. Moreover, directional consistency of greetings was low (0.65) compared to that of submissive behaviours during dyadic agonistic interactions (0.97). Instead, our data revealed that adult females greeted coalition partners and close associates, including kin, most often per opportunity, and they did so in neutral contexts more frequently than in situations characterized by social tension. Although these findings are in direct contrast to the predictions of the tension reduction and formal submission hypotheses, they strongly support the social bonding hypothesis. Importantly, the immediate act of greeting promoted cooperation among allies during intragroup and intergroup coalition formation. Thus, these risky, multimodal signals permit hyaenas to effectively communicate cooperative affiliations within a continuously shifting social milieu.},

	abstract = {Food sharing is relatively widespread across the animal kingdom, but research into the socio-ecological factors affecting this activity has predominantly focused on primates. These studies do suggest though that food tolerance is linked to the social relationship with potential partners. Therefore, the current study aimed to assess the social factors which influence food tolerance in two canids: wolves and dogs. We presented wolves and dogs with two paradigms: dyadic tolerance tests and group carcass feedings. In the dyadic setting, the affiliative relationship with a partner was the most important factor, with a strong bond promoting more sharing in both species. In the group setting, however, rank was the primary factor determining feeding behavior. Although the dominant individuals of both species defended the carcass more than subordinates, in the dogs, the subordinates mostly stayed away from the resource and the most dominant individual monopolized the food. In the wolves, the subordinates spent as much time as dominant individuals in proximity to, and feeding from, the carcass. Furthermore, subordinate wolves were more able to use persistence strategies than the dogs were. Feeding interactions in the wolves, but not dogs, were also modulated by whether the carcass was on the ground or hanging from a tree. Overall, the social relationship with a partner is important in food distribution in wolves and dogs, but the precise effects are dependent on species and feeding context. We consider how the different socio-ecologies of the two species may be linked to these findings.Significance statementDespite the fact that food sharing is relatively widespread in the animal kingdom, the specific factors underlying whether an animal will share with a specific individual are little understood. When it comes to decisions about food sharing in wolves and dogs, friendship is the deciding factor if it is just two of you, but in a bigger group rank position decides your access to the spoils. What is more, it seems that rank positioning is even more important in dogs than wolves as dominant dogs keep the food for themselves while each wolf pack member has a chance to eat. This is the first evidence that the importance of the social relationship in food sharing is dependent on the feeding context in canids.},

The observed pattern of association is tested against a randomly created one while retaining important features of the original data, for example group size and sighting frequency. We applied this new method to test four data sets of associations from two populations of Hector’s dolphin,Cephalorhynchus hectori, using the Half-Weight Index (HWI) as an example of a measure of association. The test demonstrated that populations with similar medianHWIvalues showed clear differences in association patterns, that is, some were associating nonrandomly whereas others were not. These results highlight the benefits of using this new testing method in order to validate the analysis of association indices.},

	abstract = {In most primate societies, strong and enduring social bonds form preferentially among kin, who benefit from cooperation through direct and indirect fitness gains. Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, differ from most species by showing consistent female-biased dispersal and strict male philopatry. In most East African populations, females tend to forage alone in small core areas and were long thought to have weak social bonds of little biological significance. Recent work in some populations is challenging this view. However, difficulties remain in quantifying the influence of shared space use on association patterns, and in identifying the drivers of partner preferences and social bonds. Here, we use the largest data set on wild chimpanzee behaviour currently available to assess potential determinants of female association patterns. We quantify pairwise similarities in ranging, dyadic association and grooming for 624 unique dyads over 38 years, including 17 adult female kin dyads. To search for social preferences that could not be explained by spatial overlap alone, we controlled for expected association based on pairwise kernel volume intersections of core areas. We found that association frequencies among females with above-average overlap correlated positively with grooming rates, suggesting that associations reflected social preferences in these dyads. Furthermore, when available, females preferred kin over nonkin partners for association and grooming, and variability was high among nonkin dyads. While variability in association above and below expected values was high, on average, nonkin associated more frequently if they had immature male offspring, while having female offspring had the opposite effect. Dominance rank, an important determinant of reproductive success at Gombe, influenced associations primarily for low-ranking females, who associated preferentially with each other. Our findings support the hypothesis that female chimpanzees form well-differentiated social relationships that are of potential adaptive value to females and their offspring.},

	abstract = {Long-lived animals across a range of taxa display substantial social complexity that often includes hierarchical modularity of their social structures. A complete understanding of how their social systems function is achieved by understanding not only how individuals interact with each other, but also how their social groups relate to one another. Here, we examine social relationships across two levels of the hierarchical social structure of sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus. Using an unparalleled data set of nine social units collected across a 6-year study (2005–2010), we calculate social differentiation (0 when relationships are completely homogeneous, and greater than 1 when there is considerable diversity among the relationships) to focus on the diversity of social relationships between the fundamental level of social structure, the unit. We contrast these patterns by comparing patterns between individuals within these units. Social relationships within units are diverse, with a mean social differentiation (S)±SE of 0.80±0.05 among adult females and 0.91±0.05 when calves are included. Social differentiation was also high between units (1.11±0.06). In addition, we identified long-term patterns of association between units that appear consistent over time, in two cases across more than a decade. Among the nine units, there were three strongly bonded pairs. Social preferences create complexity and diversity in the types of relationships formed at multiple levels of sperm whale social structure and across various timescales. Individuals show preferences for each other across hours, days and years; units form strong long-term bonds across decades; and vocal dialects mark social segregations between sperm whale cultures across generations.},

	abstract = {Social networks are static illustrations of dynamic societies, within which social interactions are constantly changing. Fundamental sources of variation include ranging behaviour and temporal demographic changes. Spatiotemporal dynamics can favour or limit opportunities for individuals to interact, and then a network may not essentially represent social processes. We examined whether a social network can embed such nonsocial effects in its topology, whereby emerging modules depict spatially or temporally segregated individuals. To this end, we applied a combination of spatial, temporal and demographic analyses to a long-term study of the association patterns of Guiana dolphins, Sotalia guianensis. We found that association patterns are organized into a modular social network. Space use was unlikely to reflect these modules, since dolphins' ranging behaviour clearly overlapped. However, a temporal demographic turnover, caused by the exit/entrance of individuals (most likely emigration/immigration), defined three modules of associations occurring at different times. Although this factor could mask real social processes, we identified the temporal scale that allowed us to account for these demographic effects. By looking within this turnover period (32 months), we assessed fission–fusion dynamics of the poorly known social organization of Guiana dolphins. We highlight that spatiotemporal dynamics can strongly influence the structure of social networks. Our findings show that hypothetical social units can emerge due to the temporal opportunities for individuals to interact. Therefore, a thorough search for a satisfactory spatiotemporal scale that removes such nonsocial noise is critical when analysing a social system.},

Depending on the evolutionary mechanism acting and the nature of the benefits incurred by individuals, we might expect different patterns of intra-group associations. Female and immature sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus, Linnaeus 1758) live in stable and partially matrilineal social units. Using photo identification and sloughed skin sampling for genetic determination of sex and relatedness, we investigated patterns of association within a social unit of sperm whales from the eastern Caribbean. Focus was given to how short-term spatio-temporal associations reflect relatedness among unit members. Contrary to previous findings, we found that the patterns of association among members of this unit were heterogeneous and that individuals had preferred associations or avoidances with specific individuals. Furthermore, these preferred associations correlate with relatedness between individuals, such that individuals associated more with their close relatives when variation in sociability of the individuals is controlled. These results are inconsistent with the simple equivalence model of homogeneous associations between members of a social unit. They indicate intra-unit social complexity, a basis for which seems to be genetic relatedness.},

The underlying factors that drive this variation are poorly understood. Female northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis) live in fission–fusion societies where females form preferred associations within groups that vary daily in size and composition as individuals switch roosts. The goal of our study was to test the predictions that preferred associations and social networks of female northern long-eared bats vary with reproductive period and age. We also tested the prediction that preferred relationships persist across years despite movements from summer roosts to winter hibernacula. Network analyses revealed that during gestation, females roosted in smaller groups where they roosted more regularly with fewer individuals than during lactation. This variation may reflect different social strategies to mediate higher energetic costs during lactation. Females of all ages roosted more often with younger individuals, which in turn had more direct and indirect associations than all other age classes. Younger individuals may play a role in maintaining connections between individuals, perhaps as a result of younger individuals being more exploratory. Temporal analyses suggested that relationships can persist for years as some pairs roosted together for multiple summers. We suggest that the dynamic nature of fission–fusion societies is associated with individual strategies to increase fitness relative to individual characteristics, in this case reproductive condition and age.},

We collected 726 records of group composition over a 14-month period and calculated pairwise association indices, which were tested against a null model. We found that female–female pairs, but not male–male pairs, showed both preferred and avoided relationships. We tested whether females' relationships could be explained by the degree of relatedness between pairs and whether pairs overlapped spatially. Correlations between matrices of pairwise associations, spatial overlap and relatedness showed that female–female associations were strongly correlated with amounts of spatial overlap and pairs that exhibited preferred relationships were more closely related than would be expected by chance. However, only about one-quarter of the variation in observed associations could be explained by spatial overlap and relatedness and therefore much of this variation may have been related to individual social preferences.},

Behavioural ecological studies can here provide useful insights into the structure and function of communities and their likely response to environmental changes. In this study of the Masai Mara herbivore community, we use a social network approach to investigate social affinities between species and how these change over the year in response to seasonal changes in ecological conditions. We find that even though social networks were correlated across different ecological conditions, for half the species dyads in the community, the strength of social affinities responded to changes in rainfall and/or the presence of migratory wildebeest. Several species consequentially adopted more or less central positions in the network depending on the ecological conditions. The findings point out interspecific social links that are likely to be attenuated or strengthened as a consequence of human-induced environmental changes and therefore call for particular attention from conservation managers. The eco-evolutionary ramifications of the perturbations of social affinities still require further study.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Linking behaviour to dynamics of populations and communities: application of novel approaches in behavioural ecology to conservation’.},

We describe the diets of the three groups and examine whether dietary differences between groups could be attributed to environmental differences in food abundances, to differences in the profitability of what was available or to learned local traditions. Diets were variable among groups; group A primarily ate fruit (81.2\% of feeding time) and spent little time eating insects (16.9\%), while group C was more heavily reliant on insects (44.3\%) and ate less fruit (53.0\%). Group B had a diet that was somewhat intermediate (69.8\% fruit, 29.0\% insects). By measuring the densities of all major plant foods, we were able to determine that many of the dietary differences between groups could not be attributed to simple measures of food abundance, but we could not distinguish between the food profitability hypothesis and local tradition hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Modern human societies show hierarchical social modularity (HSM) in which lower-order social units like nuclear families are nested inside increasingly larger units. It has been argued that this HSM evolved independently and after the chimpanzee–human split due to greater recognition of, and bonding between, dispersed kin. We used network modularity analysis and hierarchical clustering to quantify community structure within two western lowland gorilla populations. In both communities, we detected two hierarchically nested tiers of social structure which have not been previously quantified. Both tiers map closely to human social tiers. Genetic data from one population suggested that, as in humans, social unit membership was kin structured. The sizes of gorilla social units also showed the kind of consistent scaling ratio between social tiers observed in humans, baboons, toothed whales, and elephants. These results indicate that the hierarchical social organization observed in humans may have evolved far earlier than previously asserted and may not be a product of the social brain evolution unique to the hominin lineage.},

	abstract = {Both natural and human-related foraging strategies by the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) have resulted in social segregation in several areas of the world. Bottlenose dolphins near Savannah, Georgia beg at an unprecedented rate and also forage behind commercial shrimp trawlers, providing an opportunity to study the social ramifications of two human-related foraging behaviors within the same group of animals. Dolphins were photo-identified via surveys conducted throughout estuarine waterways around Savannah in the summers of 2009–2011. Mean half-weight indices (HWI) were calculated for each foraging class, and community division by modularity was used to cluster animals based on association indices. Pairs of trawler dolphins had a higher mean HWI (0.20 ± 0.07) than pairs of non-trawler dolphins (0.04 ± 0.02) or mixed pairs (0.02 ± 0.02). In contrast, pairs of beggars, non-beggars, and mixed pairs all had similar means, with HWI between 0.05–0.07. Community division by modularity produced a useful division (0.307) with 6 clusters. Clusters were predominately divided according to trawler status; however, beggars and non-beggars were mixed throughout clusters. Both the mean HWI and social clusters revealed that the social structure of common bottlenose dolphins near Savannah, Georgia was differentiated based on trawler status but not beg status. This finding may indicate that foraging in association with trawlers is a socially learned behavior, while the mechanisms for the propagation of begging are less clear. This study highlights the importance of taking into account the social parameters of a foraging behavior, such as how group size or competition for resources may affect how the behavior spreads. The positive or negative ramifications of homophily may influence whether the behaviors are exhibited by individuals within the same social clusters and should be considered in future studies examining social relationships and foraging behaviors.},

We test this using data from four chacma baboon troops, living in two populations that differ markedly in the degree of contest competition. As predicted by the predominance of grooming dyads in which females are closely ranked there was, in all four troops, a positive correlation between the time invested by one partner and that by the other. In addition, as predicted, the allocation of time was more closely matched in troops where grooming could not be exchanged for anything else. In troops where resource competition was high, we found in one of two troops a positive relationship between rank distance and the discrepancy in time allocation, with the lower ranking of the partners contributing more grooming.},

The articles that follow cover research on societies ranging from insects to humans. Variation in measures of fitness (i.e. survival and reproduction) has been linked to various aspects of sociality in humans and animals alike, and variability in individual health and condition has been recognized as a key mediator of these relationships. Viewed from a broad evolutionary perspective, the evolutionary transitions from a solitary lifestyle to group living have resulted in several new health-related costs and benefits of sociality. Social transmission of parasites within groups represents a major cost of group living, but some behavioural mechanisms, such as grooming, have evolved repeatedly to reduce this cost. Group living also has created novel costs in terms of altered susceptibility to infectious and non-infectious disease as a result of the unavoidable physiological consequences of social competition and integration, which are partly alleviated by social buffering in some vertebrates. Here, we define the relevant aspects of sociality, summarize their health-related costs and benefits, and discuss possible fitness measures in different study systems. Given the pervasive effects of social factors on health and fitness, we propose a synthesis of existing conceptual approaches in disease ecology, ecological immunology and behavioural neurosciences by adding sociality as a key factor, with the goal to generate a broader framework for organismal integration of health-related research.},

	abstract = {The mechanisms of pathogen transmission are often social behaviours. These occur at local scales and are affected by landscape-scale population structure. Host populations frequently exist in patchy and isolated environments that create a continuum of genetic and social familiarity. Such variability has an important multispatial effect on pathogen spread. We assessed elk dispersal (i.e. likelihood of interdeme pathogen transmission) through spatially explicit genetic analyses. At a landscape scale, the elk population was composed of one cluster within a southeast-to-northwest cline spanning three spatially discrete subpopulations of elk across two protected areas in Manitoba (Canada). Genetic data are consistent with spatial variability in apparent prevalence of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in elk. Given the existing population structure, between-subpopulation spread of disease because of elk dispersal is unlikely. Furthermore, to better understand the risk of spread and distribution of the TB, we used a combination of close-contact logging biotelemetry and genetic data, which highlights how social intercourse may affect pathogen transmission. Our results indicate that close-contact interaction rate and duration did not covary with genetic relatedness. Thus, direct elk-to-elk transmission of disease is unlikely to be constrained to related individuals. That social intercourse in elk is not limited to familial groups provides some evidence pathogen transmission may be density-dependent. We show that the combination of landscape-scale genetics, relatedness and local-scale social behaviours is a promising approach to understand and predict landscape-level pathogen transmission within our system and within all social ungulate systems affected by transmissible diseases.},

However, the relative importance of social behavior for fitness, compared to morphology and environment, remains largely unknown. We assessed the importance of sociality for fitness (lamb production and survival) in a population of marked bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) over 16 years (n = 1022 sheep-years). We constructed social networks from observations (n = 38 350) of group membership (n = 3150 groups). We then tested whether consistent individual differences in social behavior (centrality) exist and evaluated their relative importance compared to factors known to affect fitness: mass, age, parental effects, and population density. Sheep exhibited consistent individual differences in social centrality. Controlling for maternal carryover effects and age, the positive effect of centrality in a social network on adult female lamb production and survival was equal or greater than the effect of body mass or population density. Social centrality had less effect on male survival and no effect on adult male lamb production or lamb survival. Through its effect on lamb production and survival, sociality in fission-fusion animal societies may ultimately influence population dynamics equally or more than morphological or environmental effects.

In a longitudinal study of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.), calf social network structure, specifically the metric eigenvector centrality, predicted juvenile survival in males. Additionally, male calves that died post-weaning had stronger ties to juvenile males than surviving male calves, suggesting that juvenile males impose fitness costs on their younger counterparts.

This unique computational approach ensures that readers understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in their own modeling work.  The text presents generalized linear multilevel models from a Bayesian perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers from the basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and network autocorrelation.  By using complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a practical foundation for performing statistical inference. Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the natural and social sciences, it prepares them for more advanced or specialized statistical modeling.  Web ResourceThe book is accompanied by an R package (rethinking) that is available on the author’s website and GitHub. The two core functions (map and map2stan) of this package allow a variety of statistical models to be constructed from standard model formulas.},

	abstract = {Resource selection is widely appreciated to be context-dependent and shaped by both biological and abiotic factors. However, few studies have empirically assessed the extent to which selective foraging behaviour is dynamic and varies in response to environmental conditions for free-ranging animal populations. Here, we assessed the extent that forage selection fluctuated in response to different environmental conditions for a free-ranging herbivore, moose (Alces alces), in Isle Royale National Park, over a 10-year period. More precisely, we assessed how moose selection for coniferous versus deciduous forage in winter varied between geographic regions and in relation to (a) the relative frequency of forage types in the environment (e.g. frequency-dependent foraging behaviour), (b) moose abundance, (c) predation rate (by grey wolves) and (d) snow depth. These factors are potentially important for their influence on the energetics of foraging. We also built a series of food-chain models to assess the influence of dynamic foraging strategies on the stability of food webs. Our analysis indicates that moose exhibited negative frequency dependence, by selectively exploiting rare resources. Frequency-dependent foraging was further mediated by density-dependent processes, which are likely to be predation, moose abundance or some combination of both. In particular, frequency dependence was weaker in years when predation risk was high (i.e. when the ratio of moose to wolves was relatively low). Selection for conifers was also slightly weaker during deep snow years. The food-chain analysis indicates that the type of frequency-dependent foraging strategy exhibited by herbivores had important consequences for the stability of ecological communities. In particular, the dynamic foraging strategy that we observed in the empirical analysis (i.e. negative frequency dependence being mediated by density-dependent processes) was associated with more stable food web dynamics compared to fixed foraging strategies. The results of this study indicated that forage selection is a complex ecological process, varying in response to both biological (predation and moose density) and abiotic factors (snow depth) and over relatively small spatial scales (between regions). This study also provides a useful framework for assessing the influence of other aspects of foraging behaviour on the stability of food web dynamics.},

	abstract = {There is growing evidence that social bonds have adaptive consequences for individuals in many mammalian species, including savannah baboons. While the majority of studies have shown that the strength of social bonds and the extent of social integration enhance female fitness, several other investigations have suggested that the number of social bonds may sometimes may be more important than the strength or quality of females' social relationships. Here, we examine the impact of the number of strong and weak social bonds on female fertility and longevity in a population of chacma baboons,Papio ursinus. We find no evidence that the number of social bonds consistently affects fertility or infant survival to 1 year, but offspring of females with more weak social bonds lived longer than offspring of other females. After discussing several methodological issues that may influence the analyses of the effects of the number of social bonds, we re-examine the relationship between the number of weak and strong social bonds and reproductive performance using procedures that avoid these problems. Again, we find no evidence that the number of weak or strong social bonds affects females' fertility, survival to 1 year. The effects of the number of weak social bonds on infant longevity disappear, and appear to be an artefact of the relationship between the number of weak social bonds and the number of females in the group.},

	abstract = {Infanticide is common in the context of alpha male replacements (AMR), particularly in groups where alpha males experience high reproductive skew and the infants are unlikely to be related to a new alpha male. We examined the relationship between the rate of infant mortality, infant age, and the occurrence and type of AMR in white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus imitator) of the Santa Rosa population in Sector Santa Rosa, Área de Conservación Guanacaste. Specifically, we investigated how the source of the new alpha male (coresident or extragroup) and relative aggression level during AMRs influenced infant mortality in this species. Between 1986 and 2015, we recorded 221 births in five study groups. Infants present at the time of an AMR, or born within 5.5 months following an AMR (i.e., conceived prior to AMR), experienced significantly higher mortality than those born during periods of group stability. Infant age was a significant predictor of infant survival, with the probability of surviving increasing by 0.4\% for each additional day older an infant was at the time of the AMR. Infant mortality rates did not differ between AMRs by coresident males and extragroup males, possibly because the degree of relatedness between infants and new alphas did not significantly differ between coresident and extragroup AMRs. Infant mortality rates did not differ significantly between aggressive AMRs and more peaceful AMRs. Our results are consistent with predictions derived from the sexual selection hypothesis (SSH) of infanticide and suggest that future studies examine the role of testosterone as an underlying proximate mechanism for the aggression leading to this behavior. We argue that the sexual selection and generalized aggression hypotheses (GAH) of infanticide are best considered as different levels of analysis rather than competing hypotheses.},

However, this figure does not include other, more cryptic but pervasive forms of degradation, such as overhunting. Here, we quantified and mapped the spatial patterns of mammal defaunation in the tropics using a database of 3,281 mammal abundance declines from local hunting studies. We simultaneously accounted for population abundance declines and the probability of local extirpation of a population as a function of several predictors related to human accessibility to remote areas and species’ vulnerability to hunting. We estimated an average abundance decline of 13\% across all tropical mammal species, with medium-sized species being reduced by {\textgreater}27\% and large mammals by {\textgreater}40\%. Mammal populations are predicted to be partially defaunated (i.e., declines of 10\%–100\%) in ca. 50\% of the pantropical forest area (14 million km2), with large declines ({\textgreater}70\%) in West Africa. According to our projections, 52\% of the intact forests (IFs) and 62\% of the wilderness areas (WAs) are partially devoid of large mammals, and hunting may affect mammal populations in 20\% of protected areas (PAs) in the tropics, particularly in West and Central Africa and Southeast Asia. The pervasive effects of overhunting on tropical mammal populations may have profound ramifications for ecosystem functioning and the livelihoods of wild-meat-dependent communities, and underscore that forest coverage alone is not necessarily indicative of ecosystem intactness. We call for a systematic consideration of hunting effects in (large-scale) biodiversity assessments for more representative estimates of human-induced biodiversity loss.},

	abstract = {Fitness costs of reproduction are expected when resources are limited. Costs drive the evolution of life-history strategies and can affect population dynamics if females change their allocation of resources to reproduction. We studied fitness costs of reproduction in mountain ungulates in Alberta, Canada. We monitored two populations of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) for 44 and 30 years, and one of mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) for 30 years. Both species are highly iteroparous. Heterogeneity in individual reproductive potential makes fitness costs of reproduction difficult to detect and quantify without manipulations. In capital breeders, individual differences can be partly accounted for by considering body mass and other correlates of reproductive potential. Long-term monitoring can reveal costs that only manifest under stressful conditions such as disease or resource scarcity. Despite individual differences in reproductive potential, we detected fitness costs of reproduction in females. Costs, in terms of mass gain and survival, are almost entirely born by subsequent offspring, as mothers prioritize their own maintenance and survival. Costs are greater for primiparous females, decrease with increasing body mass and increase as resource availability declines, and sons are costlier than daughters. Costs may increase for senescent females that appear to reduce allocation to reproduction. In bighorn sheep, costs mostly involve reduced mass gain and lower survival of subsequent offspring. In mountain goats, costs include reductions in mass gain, subsequent fecundity and juvenile survival. In males, fitness costs derive mostly from attempts to reproduce rather than from siring success and likely depend upon individual competitiveness. In the absence of selective harvests, dominant males may enjoy high fitness and possibly lower costs compared to subordinates. The conservative reproductive tactic of mountain ungulate females likely explains why density dependence mostly involves later primiparity and lower recruitment, but rarely affects adult survival. Future research will seek to better account for heterogeneity in reproductive potential, assess cumulative reproductive costs and investigate the potential effects of fathers on maternal allocation tactics.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The rapid growth of contemporary human foragers and steady decline of chimpanzees represent puzzling population paradoxes, as any species must exhibit near-stationary growth over much of their evolutionary history. We evaluate the conditions favoring zero population growth (ZPG) among 10 small-scale subsistence human populations and five wild chimpanzee groups according to four demographic scenarios: altered mean vital rates (i.e., fertility and mortality), vital rate stochasticity, vital rate covariance, and periodic catastrophes. Among most human populations, changing mean fertility or survivorship alone requires unprecedented alterations. Stochastic variance and covariance would similarly require major adjustment to achieve ZPG in most populations. Crashes could maintain ZPG in slow-growing populations but must be frequent and severe in fast-growing populations—more extreme than observed in the ethnographic record. A combination of vital rate alteration with catastrophes is the most realistic solution to the forager population paradox. ZPG in declining chimpanzees is more readily obtainable through reducing mortality and altering covariance. While some human populations may have hovered near ZPG under harsher conditions (e.g., violence or food shortage), modern \textit{Homo sapiens} were equipped with the potential to rapidly colonize new habitats and likely experienced population fluctuations and local extinctions over evolutionary history.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Social relationships are composed of both positive (affiliative) and negative (agonistic) interactions, representing opposing effects. Social network theory predicts that positive relationships should be transitive; thus, the friend of a friend is more likely to be a friend. Further, when considering both positive and negative relationships jointly, structural balance theory predicts that certain configurations of positive and negative relationships in a triad are inherently less stable (unbalanced) and should tend to be eliminated. However, structural balance has been rarely examined in nonhuman social systems. We tested for transitivity and structural balance in social networks of socially flexible yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer) and asked if group size, network density, or group composition affected the degree of structural balance. We found a consistent pattern of significant transitivity in positive interactions, some transitivity in negative interactions, and some evidence of structural balance. In particular, a “weak” definition of structural balance is probably more common than “strong” structural balance, which used a stricter definition of balance. Network size limited the ability to detect these social processes, and smaller networks were less likely to show significant transitivity or structural balance. The proportion of adult females in a group affected the level of transitivity but did not affect the degree of structural balance. Our study suggests that there are intriguing similarities in social processes across diverse animal societies and that studying triads and network motifs may help identify basic social mechanisms linking local to global structure.Significance statementSocial network theory predicts that basic social mechanisms should lead to similar structural properties across different societies. For example, positive relationships should be transitive (a friend of a friend is a friend), and certain combinations of positive and negative relationships represent conflict and should be unstable over time (e.g., a friend of a friend being an enemy is an unstable state). This latter theory, called structural balance, has rarely been examined in nonhuman societies; hence, we tested for transitivity and structural balance in groups of free-living yellow-bellied marmots. Positive interactions were generally transitive, but evidence for structural balance was inconsistent. Furthermore, group composition could affect network transitivity, and small network size (associated with few interactions) limits ability to detect significant patterns. Our results suggest that transitivity is fundamental in structuring positive relationships, while some forms of structural balance are present but not widespread.},

	abstract = {The expensive brain hypothesis predicts that the lowest stable level of energy input sets the upper limit to a species’ brain size. This prediction receives comparative support from the effects of experienced seasonality (including hibernation) and diet quality on mammalian brain size. Here, we test another prediction, which concerns the temporal stability of energy inputs. Allomaternal care in mammals can be provided by breeding males or other helpers (usually earlier offspring). Male care should be stable and reliable since otherwise no breeding would occur. Care by others, in contrast, should fluctuate, as the availability of helpers often varies. One would therefore predict, other things being equal, that the presence of male care in addition to maternal care should show positive correlated evolution with brain size, whereas care by others would not. However, because females can readily respond through litter size adjustments to variable amounts of energy inputs, helper inputs may be used to increase fertility. A detailed comparative analysis of a large sample of mammals (N = 478 species) showed that male help is correlated with the evolution of larger brains, whereas alloparental help is correlated with higher fertility, but only in species where male care is also present (as in cooperative breeders). Humans evolved an unusual form of multi-family cooperative breeding, which involves stable and reliable care by both fathers and alloparents. This combination helps to explain why humans differ from the other apes in having both an extremely large brain and a relatively high reproductive output.Significance statementAllomaternal care provides breeding females with energy, directly or indirectly, and so would be expected to affect fertility and/or brain size. Which path evolution actually took remains controversial, partly because previous studies did not separate between care provided by the breeding male (paternal care) and care by non-breeding helpers (alloparental care). We distinguish between them because we expect that selection only favours increased brain size if the increase in energy available to the female is predictable and constant. Using a sample of 478 mammals, we show that paternal care, which is both reliable and stable, shows correlated evolution with brain size, whereas alloparental care, which fluctuates with varying availability of helpers, is correlated with higher fertility. Thus, constraints on brain size, imposed by its high-energy costs, may predict brain size better than the fitness benefits of improved cognitive abilities per se.},

We present a multilevel modeling formulation of the Social Relations Model that is well suited for the analysis of dyadic network data. This model, which we adapt for count data and small datasets, can be fitted using standard multilevel modeling software packages. We illustrate this model with an analysis of meal sharing among Ye'kwana horticulturalists in Venezuela. In this setting, meal sharing among households is predicted by an association index, which reflects the amount of time that members of the households are interacting. This result replicates recent findings that interhousehold food sharing is especially prevalent among households that interact and cooperate in multiple ways. We discuss opportunities for human behavioral ecologists to expand their focus to the multiple currencies and cooperative behaviors that characterize interpersonal relationships in preindustrial societies. We discuss possible extensions to this statistical modeling approach and applications to research by human behavioral ecologists and primatologists.

The present research observes transfers of meat over a yearlong period among 25 households of indigenous Mayangna and Miskito horticulturalists in Nicaragua. To analyze these data, we extend the multilevel formulation of the social relations model to count data, namely the number of portions of meat exchanged between households. Along with other covariates, we examine the effect of an “association index,” which reflects the amount of time that households interact with one another. The association index exhibits a positive effect on sharing, and our overall results indicate that food sharing networks largely correspond to kin-based networks of social interaction, suggesting that food sharing is embedded in broader social relationships between households. We discuss possible extensions of our methodological approach, as appropriate for research on food sharing and social network analysis more broadly.},

Climate change is an additional threat, which alone or in combination with other drivers, may severely impact those taxa unable to track suitable environmental conditions. Here, we investigate the extent of climate and land use/cover (LUC) change-related risks for primates. We employed an analytical approach to objectively select a subset of climate scenarios, for which we then calculated changes in climatic and LUC conditions for 2050 across primate ranges (N = 426 species) under a best-case scenario and a worst-case scenario. Generalized linear models were used to examine whether these changes varied according to region, conservation status, range extent and dominant habitat. Finally, we reclassified primate ranges based on different magnitudes of maximum temperature change, and quantified the proportion of ranges overall and of primate hotspots in particular that are likely to be exposed to extreme temperature increases. We found that, under the worst-case scenario, 74\% of Neotropical forest-dwelling primates are likely to be exposed to maximum temperature increases up to 7°C. In contrast, 38\% of Malagasy savanna primates will experience less pronounced warming of up to 3.5°C. About one quarter of Asian and African primates will face up to 50\% crop expansion within their range. Primary land (undisturbed habitat) is expected to disappear across species' ranges, whereas secondary land (disturbed habitat) will increase by up to 98\%. With 86\% of primate ranges likely to be exposed to maximum temperature increases {\textgreater}3°C, primate hotspots in the Neotropics are expected to be particularly vulnerable. Our study highlights the fundamental exposure risk of a large percentage of primate ranges to predicted climate and LUC changes. Importantly, our findings underscore the urgency with which climate change mitigation measures need to be implemented to avert primate extinctions on an unprecedented scale.},

	abstract = {Background: Specific gravity (SG) may perform as well as creatinine (CR) correction for adjusting urinary hormone concentrations, as well as offer some advantages. We compared the two methods and applied them to US and Bangladeshi specimens to evaluate their use in different populations.
Methods: Pearson correlations between serum concentrations and SG, CR, and uncorrected urinary concentrations were compared using paired daily urine and serum specimens from one menstrual cycle from 30 US women. Corrected urinary estrone conjugate and pregnanediol glucuronide concentrations were compared with serum estradiol and progesterone. Urine specimens across one menstrual cycle from 13 Bangladeshi women were used to evaluate the applicability of both methods to a nonindustrialized population. Linear mixed-effects models were used to compare CR and SG values in the Bangladeshi vs US specimens.
Results: There was no significant difference between SG-corrected vs serum and CR-corrected vs serum correlations for either assay. Usable CR results were obtained for all US specimens, but 37\% of the Bangladeshi specimens were below the CR assay limit of detection. The Bangladeshi sample had significantly lower CR and higher inter- and intrasubject CR variability than the US sample.
Conclusions: SG is a potentially useful alternative to CR correction for normalizing urinary steroid hormone concentrations, particularly in settings where CR values are highly variable or unusually low.},

	abstract = {The effects of group size and fruit availability in tree crowns on per-capita food intake was examined for wild brown capuchin monkeys living in groups of 3-12 individuals. Per-capita feeding time was nearly exactly inversely proportional to group size in small-crowned trees with little fruit, but was essentially independent of group size in large-crowned trees with abundant fruit. Despite the use of such productive trees, per-capita feeding time in the average tree visited decreased by 50\% over a 4-fold range of group sizes. This cost of indirect food competition in large groups was not compensated by increased rates of ingestion, preferential use of large trees, of a higher rate of fruit tree encounter per distance travelled. Instead, foraging effort (distance travelled, number of minutes devoted to foraging, total activity minutes per day) increased at large group sizes. Estimates of total energy intake and expenditure suggest that net energy gain is constant for individuals in group sizes of 5-12. I suggest that the upper limit to group size is set by the daylength available for foraging in large groups. Aggression in food trees increased in frequency in larger groups, but the relative feeding rates of dominants and subordinates of a given rank did not appear to depend on group size. Observed decreases in per-capita food intake due to either indirect or aggressive food competition within large groups are substantially greater than the 4\% gain in mean food intake that large groups achieve by displacing smaller groups from fruit trees.},

	abstract = {The proximate causes of variation in glucocorticoids (GCs) of many free-ranging primates are still unclear, and in some cases, the available evidence is contradictory. Such is the case of mantled howler monkeys. In the present study, we tested whether variation in GC levels in this species could be predicted by energetic challenges or by psychosocial stressors. We focused on two groups living in Los Tuxtlas (Veracruz, Mexico) that differed in a number of parameters including: group size, habitat size, number of groups, and solitary males within the same habitat. Furthermore, one of the groups experienced changes in composition during our observations. From March to December 2009 we determined food availability in each group's habitat, studied the behavior of all adult individuals (N = 17), including, feeding, time budgets, ranging, and social interactions (N = 426.6 h), and measured weekly GCs in fecal samples (N = 160 individual/weeks) of both females and males. We found that participation in agonistic interactions, which were more frequent in the group that lived in the smaller habitat, was associated with increased weekly GCs, particularly in pregnant and lactating females. During the dry season weekly GCs were also higher in the group that lived in the smaller habitat. Although in this group individuals significantly increased travel time during the dry season, weekly GC levels were unrelated to time-budgets or ranging distances, contrasting with previous findings on mantled howler monkeys' GC response. We found no evidence that weekly variation in GC levels between groups resulted from differences in food availability. Our results indicate that mantled howler monkey GC levels respond to the effects of agonism, reproductive state, and the influence of a seasonal stressor, which may be attributable to anthropogenic disturbance. We conclude that psychosocial stressors affect the GC response of mantled howler monkeys, and that this response is modulated by reproductive state. Am. J.

	abstract = {Objectives Interbirth intervals (IBIs) are a key metric of female reproductive success; understanding how they are regulated by environmental, social, and demographic factors can provide insight into sources of variance in female fitness. Materials and Methods Using 36 years of reproductive data on 490 IBIs for 160 wild female baboons, we identified sources of variance in the duration of IBIs and of their component phases: postpartum amenorrhea (PPA), sexual cycling, and pregnancy. We also examined how body fat and fecal hormone concentrations varied during female IBIs. Results We found that IBIs tended to be shorter (reproduction was accelerated) when female traits and environmental variables promoted energy acquisition, but with different specific effects for different component phases of the IBI. We also found that females lost a substantial amount of body fat during PPA, indicating that PPA imposes accumulating energetic costs as it progresses. Prior to cycle resumption females began to regain body fat; body fat was stable across the cycling phase and increased throughout most of pregnancy. However, body fat scores per se were not associated with the duration of any of the component phases. Finally, we found that fecal glucocorticoid concentrations decreased as PPA progressed, suggesting a decline in energetic stress over this phase. Fecal progestogen and estrogen concentrations changed over time during sexual cycling; the direction of these changes depended on the phase of the sexual cycle (luteal versus early or late follicular phases). Discussion Our study lends insight into the energetic constraints on female primate reproduction, revealing how female environments, changes in body fat, and steroid hormone concentrations relate to IBI duration and to reproductive readiness.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this article is to compare the energetics of reproduction for human and other primates in order to evaluate the extent to which human reproductive energetics are distinct from other primates and other large-bodied placental mammals. The article also evaluates the energetics of human and primate gestation and lactation using data from a variety of different populations living under different environmental circumstances. Energetics refers to energy intake and expenditure, and changes in body fat stores. Human and nonhuman primates have longer periods of gestation and lactation and slower prenatal and postnatal growth than other mammals of similar size. This reduces daily maternal energy costs. The development of sizable fat stores is not unique to humans, but fat stores are typically greater in human females and may play a greater role in reproduction. The strategies used to meet the energy costs of pregnancy vary among populations of humans and nonhuman primates and among humans interindividual variability is high. In pregnancy, some increase energy intake but others apparently do not. Increases in metabolic efficiency are evident in some human populations, whereas decreases in physical activity occur, but are not seen in all human or primate populations. Lactation is more energetically costly on a daily basis among humans and nonhuman primates, but has not been as well studied. It appears that both nonhuman and human primates tend to increase energy intake to meet in part the cost of lactation. They also use other strategies such as relying on body tissue stores, reductions in physical activity, and/or increases in metabolic efficiency to meet the remainder of the cost. It is also clear that human females in different populations and different women in the same population use a different combination of strategies to meet the cost of lactation. Am. J. Hum.

	abstract = {Sexual conflict develops when the optimal reproductive strategy for one sex inflicts fitness costs upon the other sex. Among species with intense within-group feeding competition and high costs of reproduction, females are expected to experience reduced foraging efficiency by associating with males, and this may compromise their reproductive ability. Here, we test this hypothesis in chimpanzees, a species with flexible grouping patterns in which female avoidance of large subgroups has been attributed to their relatively high costs of grouping. In an {\textgreater}11-year study of the Kanyawara community of East African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in the Kibale National Park, Uganda, the availability of sexually receptive females was a key determinant of the number of males in parties. In turn, females experienced significantly lower C-peptide of insulin levels, indicative of reduced energy balance, during periods when they associated with more males. Female associates did not produce the same negative effect. C-peptide levels positively and significantly predicted female ovarian steroid production, indicating that the costs of associating with males can lead to downstream reproductive costs. Therefore, we conclude that Kanyawara chimpanzees exhibit sexual conflict over subgroup formation, with the large groupings that allow males to compete for mating opportunities inflicting energetic and reproductive costs on females. Because association with males is central to female chimpanzees’ anti-infanticide strategy, and males may confer other benefits, we propose that reproductive success in female chimpanzees hinges on a delicate balance between the costs and benefits of associating with male conspecifics.},

	abstract = {An important adaptive problem for mammals in general, and primates in particular, is how females can manage the high costs of reproduction in the face of fluctuating energetic supplies. For many species, the best solution is to breed seasonally such that high costs are temporally coincident with predictable periods of resource abundance. This is an unreliable strategy for some primates, such as chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), for which large body size forces an increase in dietary complexity and prolonged reproductive efforts. Here, I review data on reproductive function in chimpanzees, a species that demonstrates a risk-averse reproductive strategy wherein reproductive investment is allocated in accordance with maternal condition. Life history parameters for chimpanzees indicate that most females produce very few surviving offspring. However, comparisons between captive and wild populations and within wild populations illustrate that variation in resource access leads to highly variable reproductive success. Focused hormonal studies have demonstrated these effects at a proximate level, with energetic influences on female dispersal, receptivity, cycle quality, conception success, and lactational amenorrhea. Downstream of these effects, female reproductive function affects sexual attractiveness, and by virtue of males’ own optimal reproductive strategies, can lead to coercive aggression and decreased foraging efficiency. Because of their extreme reproductive costs, female chimpanzees utilize a highly conservative reproductive strategy, one that minimizes the costs of ecological variation but makes them vulnerable to sexual conflict and costs of sociality.

We develop and apply multilevel, multinomial logistic regression models for analyzing such data. These statistical methods correspond to the multinomial character of the response variable while also accounting for the repeated observations of individuals that characterize behavioral datasets. Correlated random effects potentially reveal individual-level trade-offs across behaviors, allowing for models that reveal the extent to which individuals who regularly engage in one behavior also exhibit relatively more or less of another behavior. Using an example dataset, we demonstrate the estimation of these models using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms, as implemented in the RStan package in the R statistical environment. The supplemental files include a coding script and data that demonstrate auxiliary functions to prepare the data, estimate the models, summarize the posterior samples, and generate figures that display model predictions. We discuss possible extensions to our approach, including models with random slopes to allow individual-level behavioral strategies to vary over time and the need for models that account for temporal autocorrelation. These models can potentially be applied to a broad class of statistical analyses by behavioral ecologists, focusing on other polytomous response variables, such as behavior, habitat choice, or emotional states.},

This study includes records of 1401 individuals collected at monthly intervals for over 12 yr, 984 of which survived throughout the entire study period. The aims of this study were to: (1) quantitate inter-annual trends in species and forest scale fruit presence; and (2) test the importance of rainfall in explaining inter-annual fruit presence variability. Long-term upward trends in the expected proportion of individuals with fruits were found for the majority of species, while no significant downward trends were detected, driving a significant upward trend at the community level. Peak production months of the upward trending species were not associated with the dry or wet season. Significant rainfall correlations with the total proportion of individuals showing fruit were generally negative, with only five species showing significant positive correlations. Taken together, these results suggest that the observed inter-annual trends and variability of fruit abundance are currently not associated with rainfall.

Using an integrated theoretical and experimental approach (employing immersive virtual reality), we consider the interplay between movement and vectorial integration during decision-making regarding two, or more, options in space. In computational models of this process, we reveal the occurrence of spontaneous and abrupt “critical” transitions (associated with specific geometrical relationships) whereby organisms spontaneously switch from averaging vectorial information among, to suddenly excluding one among, the remaining options. This bifurcation process repeats until only one option—the one ultimately selected—remains. Thus, we predict that the brain repeatedly breaks multichoice decisions into a series of binary decisions in space–time. Experiments with fruit flies, desert locusts, and larval zebrafish reveal that they exhibit these same bifurcations, demonstrating that across taxa and ecological contexts, there exist fundamental geometric principles that are essential to explain how, and why, animals move the way they do.},

Many reports have revealed that humans are not the only species affected by the death of group members. Non-human primates in particular show behaviors such as congregating around the deceased, carrying the corpse for prolonged periods of time (predominantly mothers carrying dead infants), and inspecting the corpse for signs of life. Here, we extend the focus on death-related responses in non-human animals by exploring whether chimpanzees are inclined to console the bereaved: the individual(s) most closely associated with the deceased. We report a case in which a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) mother experienced the loss of her fully developed infant (presumed stillborn). Using observational data to compare the group members’ behavior before and after the death, we found that a substantial number of group members selectively increased their affiliative expressions toward the bereaved mother. Moreover, on the day of the death, we observed heightened expressions of species-typical reassurance behaviors toward the bereaved mother. After ruling out several alternative explanations, we propose that many of the chimpanzees consoled the bereaved mother by means of affiliative and selective empathetic expressions.},

	abstract = {Coordination is a fundamental aspect of social living, underlying processes ranging from the maintenance of group cohesion to the avoidance of competition. Coordination can manifest as synchronization, where individuals perform the same action at the same time but can also take the form of anti-synchronization or turn-taking. Turn-taking has mainly been studied in the context of the development of language [1] due to the fact that it is a universal feature in all languages and has been found to appear early in infancy [2, 3]. Recently, turn-taking has received attention in animal communication research [4, 5, 6, 7] as a potential foundation on which social communication was formed [1, 3]. In this study, we describe turn-taking in group-wide vocal interactions of meerkats (Suricata suricatta) during low-conflict sunning behavior, which is accompanied by the production of specific “sunning calls.” We show that sunning-call production is socially stimulated and that at the group level, meerkats avoid overlap, thus fulfilling a key principle of turn-taking [8]. Through observational data and playback experiments, we show that these group-level patterns arise from two individual-level rules: call inhibition over short timescales, which prevents mutual interference, and call excitation over longer timescales, which stimulates further group calling. These simple rules suggest that hierarchy formation and turn allocation are not required for achieving group-wide coordination of communication. We also suggest that the potential bonding function of turn-taking shown in humans might have similar effects in animal interactions.

	abstract = {The type and variety of learning strategies used by individuals to acquire behaviours in the wild are poorly understood, despite the presence of behavioural traditions in diverse taxa. Social learning strategies such as conformity can be broadly adaptive, but may also retard the spread of adaptive innovations. Strategies like pay-off-biased learning, by contrast, are effective at diffusing new behaviour but may perform poorly when adaptive behaviour is common. We present a field experiment in a wild primate, Cebus capucinus, that introduced a novel food item and documented the innovation and diffusion of successful extraction techniques. We develop a multilevel, Bayesian statistical analysis that allows us to quantify individual-level evidence for different social and individual learning strategies. We find that pay-off-biased and age-biased social learning are primarily responsible for the diffusion of new techniques. We find no evidence of conformity; instead rare techniques receive slightly increased attention. We also find substantial and important variation in individual learning strategies that is patterned by age, with younger individuals being more influenced by both social information and their own individual experience. The aggregate cultural dynamics in turn depend upon the variation in learning strategies and the age structure of the wild population.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial animals feed on fruit dropped by arboreal frugivores in tropical forests around the world, but it remains unknown whether the resulting spatial associations of these animals are coincidental or intentionally maintained. On Barro Colorado Island, Panama, we used a combination of acoustic playback experiments, remote camera monitoring, and GPS tracking to quantify the frequency of such interactions, determine who initiates and maintains spatial associations, and test whether terrestrial animals adopt a strategy of acoustic eavesdropping to locate fruit patches created by foraging primates. Indeed, 90\% of fruits collected in fruit fall traps had tooth marks of arboreal frugivores, and terrestrial frugivores visited fruit trees sooner following visits by GPS-collared monkeys. While our play back experiments were insufficient to support the hypothesis that terrestrial frugivores use auditory cues to locate food dropped by arboreal primates, analyses of movement paths of capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus), spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi), and coatis (Nasua narica) reveal that observed patterns of interspecific attraction are not merely a byproduct of mutual attraction to shared resources. Coatis were significantly more likely to initiate close encounters with arboreal primates than vice versa and maintained these associations by spending significantly longer periods at fruiting trees when collared primates were present. Our results demonstrate that terrestrial frugivores are attracted to arboreal primates, likely because they increase local resource availability. Primates are often among the first species in a habitat to be extirpated by hunting; our results suggest that their loss may have unanticipated consequences for the frugivore community.

	abstract = {, For humans we implicitly assume that the way we do things is the product of social learning and thus cultural. For animals, this conclusion requires proof. Here, we first review the most commonly used procedure for documenting animal culture: the method of exclusion, which charts geographic behavioral variation between populations as evidence for culture. Using published data, we show that, whereas it is an adequate proof of principle, the method of exclusion has major deficiencies when capturing cultural diversity and complexity. Therefore, we propose a new method, namely the direct counting of socially learned skills, which we apply to previously collected data on wild orangutans. This method reveals a far greater cultural repertoire among orangutans, and a different distribution of cultural elements among behavioral domains than found by the method of exclusion, as well as clear ecological correlates for most cultural elements. The widespread occurrence of social learning ability throughout the animal kingdom suggests that these conclusions also apply to many other species. Culture is most likely more widespread and pervasive than commonly thought and an important avenue to local adaptation. The complex and normative dimensions of culture seem unique to our species, but were most likely built upon a very broad, pre-existing cultural capacity that we inherited from our ancestors.},

An increasing body of research has not only evidenced the occurrence of cultural behaviour in nonhuman animals, but also hypothesized that such cultures could ‘evolve’ over time in a way that shares key characteristics with biological evolution, including through a process of selection on variance, inheritance and adaptation. Outside of humans, song and contact calls in birds provide by far the most comprehensive evidence for culture and cultural evolution. However, birds have often been considered ‘one-trick cultural ponies’, only exhibiting significant diversity in this single component of their behavioural repertoire. Recent studies have begun to challenge this view. Here, I review the evidence across multiple behavioural domains for wild cultures in birds. I then discuss the evidence in birds for four key concepts of cultural evolution: (1) variation, selection, inheritance, (2) adaptation, (3) geographical and demographic processes and (4) the accumulation of modifications. I incorporate the evidence from birdsong with other behavioural domains for each key concept and identify important gaps in knowledge. Finally, I discuss how taking a cultural evolution perspective can be informative for our understanding of cognitive ecology more broadly.},

	abstract = {Movement of individual organisms is fundamental to life, quilting our planet in a rich tapestry of phenomena with diverse implications for ecosystems and humans. Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes.

	abstract = {An adaptationist programme has dominated evolutionary thought in England and the United States during the past 40 years. It is based on faith in the power of natural selection as an optimizing agent. It proceeds by breaking an organism into unitary ‘traits’ and proposing an adaptive story for each considered separately. Trade-offs among competing selective demands exert the only brake upon perfection; non-optimality is thereby rendered as a result of adaptation as well. We criticize this approach and attempt to reassert a competing notion (long popular in continental Europe) that organisms must be analysed as integrated wholes, with Baupläne so constrained by phyletic heritage, pathways of development and general architecture that the constraints themselves become more interesting and more important in delimiting pathways of change than the selective force that may mediate change when it occurs. We fault the adaptationist programme for its failure to distinguish current utility from reasons for origin (male tyrannosaurs may have used their diminutive front legs to titillate female partners, but this will not explain why they got so small); for its unwillingness to consider alternatives to adaptive stories; for its reliance upon plausibility alone as a criterion for accepting speculative tales; and for its failure to consider adequately such competing themes as random fixation of alleles, production of non-adaptive structures by developmental correlation with selected features (allometry, pleiotropy, material compensation, mechanically forced correlation), the separability of adaptation and selection, multiple adaptive peaks, and current utility as an epiphenomenon of non-adaptive structures. We support Darwin’s own pluralistic approach to identifying the agents of evolutionary change.},

Here, we investigate the effects of an uncharacteristically long period of fruit scarcity, following widespread thick haze caused by peat and forest fires in 2015, on the behaviour and sociality of female Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii). We collected data from 2010 to 2018 at Tuanan, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, and compared the activity, diet, and association patterns of adult females during low-fruit periods before the fires, i.e., regular, seasonal periods of low fruit availability (“pre-fire”), and after the fires, i.e., during the extended period of low fruit availability (“post-fire”). First, we found that, post-fire, female orangutans adopted a more extreme energy-saving activity pattern and diet —resting more, travelling less, and diet-switching to less-preferred foods — compared to pre-fire. Second, we found that the probabilities of association between females and their weaned immature offspring, and between related and unrelated adult females were lower, and the probability of agonism between unrelated females was higher, post-fire than pre-fire. This change in energetic strategy, and the general reduction in gregariousness and social tolerance, demonstrates how forest fires can have lasting consequences for orangutans. Fission–fusion species such as orangutans can mitigate the effects of changes in resource landscapes by altering their (sub)grouping patterns; however, this may have long-term indirect consequences on their fitness.},

	abstract = {A fundamental ecological question is what determines the abundance of animals? Answering this question is vital in the formulation of effective management plans for endangered or threatened species. However, there are few general hypotheses proposed to account for variation in animal abundance. Studies of folivorous primates are a notable exception. In this group, the protein to fibre ratio of mature leaves is a significant predictor of biomass. However, Dasilva (1992) suggested that the availability of energy may play a critical role in colobine behaviour and ecology. Here we evaluate the importance of food energy content for the red colobus (Procolobus badius) and black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza) monkeys of Kibale National Park, Uganda. Energy was found to be of little importance. None of the eight groups studied selected high-energy foods: there was no correlation between food energy content and foraging effort. For all groups, estimates of energy expenditure [daily energy expenditure (DEE) and average daily metabolic needs (ADMN)] were less than estimates of energy consumption. Finally, the average energy content of mature leaves from the 20 most abundant tree species at four sites was not related to colobine biomass. In contrast, the protein and fibre content of foods was important to both colobine species. Seven of the eight groups selected foods with a high-protein, low-fibre content. The average protein to fibre ratio of mature leaves from the 20 most abundant tree species at four sites was correlated positively with colobine biomass. This study provides further validation of the protein to fibre model, suggesting the importance of this model for conservation and management of colobus monkeys, with the potential application to other small mammalian herbivores.},

The synthesis draws attention to how fundamentally different tropical phenology data can be to temperate data. Tropical plants lack a phase of winter dormancy and may grow and reproduce continually. Seasonal patterns in environmental parameters, such as rainfall, irradiance or temperature, do not necessarily coincide temporally, as they do in temperate climes. We review recent research on the drivers of phenophase cycles in individual trees, species and communities and highlight how significant innovations in biometric tools and approaches are being driven by the need to deal with circular data, the complexity of defining tropical seasons and the myriad growth and reproductive strategies used by tropical plants. We discuss how important the use of leaf phenology (or remotely-sensed proxies of leaf phenophases) has become in tracking biome responses to climate change at the continental level and how important the phenophase of forests can be in determining local weather conditions. We also highlight how powerful analyses of plant responses are hampered at many tropical sites by a lack of contextual data on local environmental conditions. We conclude by arguing that there is a clear global benefit in increasing long term tropical phenology data collection and improving empirical collection of local climate measures, contemporary to the phenology data. Directing more resources to research in this sector will be widely beneficial.},

A key question is thus whether cooperation confers more subtle benefits, for example by allowing access to higher quality resources through competitive exclusion of less social rivals. In other words, it is not clear whether defendable resources are a necessary precondition for sociality or whether they also contribute to the maintenance and enhancement of cooperative societies. Here, we highlight how advances in imaging technology, machine-­learning, and environmental reconstruction enable the collection of behavioural and ecological data in unparalleled quantity and quality to address this question. These new techniques are especially suited to compare small-­ scale differences in resource use between cooperative and non-­cooperative species that share a general habitat and have similar ecologies. The lamprologine cichlids of Lake Tanganyika are a prominent example of such a system and Michael Taborsky's pioneering work on this group has done much to promote these fishes as models of social evolution. We show that habitat features indicative of increased resource quality, namely increased stone cover, are indeed associated with the distribution of cooperative cichlids—­at least where these resources are relatively scarce. We thus support a point Michael Taborsky made in 1981: the evolution of cooperative behaviour among cichlids is tied to their close association with a crucial resource, the substrate in which they hide and breed. In the future, the techniques we introduce here will allow to also investigate whether this substrate is indeed more than just the necessary precondition for cooperation among fishes; in addition, they will likely find application in a wide range of research fields interested in the interplay between biotic and abiotic environmental factors.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Colobine monkeys are specialized folivores that use foregut fermentation to digest leaves. The slow process of fermentation forces them to spend a lot of time resting and to minimize their energy expenditure to subsist on a lower-quality diet. Methods: We recorded the diet and activity budget of Colobus angolensis ruwenzorii, which form a three-tiered multi-level society, at Lake Nabugabo, Uganda, over 12 months using scan sampling on adults and subadults, to determine whether they utilize the energy minimization strategy typical of colobines. Results: We found that the annual diet was primarily comprised of high-quality food resources (young leaves 65\% and fruit 31\%), and fruits were the only plant part the monkeys selected when available. Both the fruits and young leaves of some species were preferred food items in some months, and mature leaf consumption correlated negatively with preferred food availability. Mature leaves appear to be a fallback food for this population but are rarely relied upon (3\%). The C. a. ruwenzorii at Nabugabo spent less time resting (40\%) and more time moving (25\%) than is typical for other species of black-and-white colobus. Discussion/Conclusion: The high-quality diet of this population appears to allow them to utilize an energy maximization strategy. Their reliance on food items that tend to be clumped in space and time likely explains the frequent fission-fusion behaviour that we observe between core units. Our findings demonstrate that the foraging strategies of colobines may be more flexible than was previously thought and illustrate how food availability and distribution can impact primate social organization.},

	abstract = {Apposite conceptualization and measurement of resource variation is critical for understanding many issues in ecology, including ecological niches, persistence and distribution of populations, the structure of communities and population resilience to perturbations. We apply the nutritional geometry framework to conceptualize and quantify the responses of a temperate-living primate, the golden snub-nosed monkey Rhinopithecus roxellana to variation in resource quality and quantity and in nutrient requirements associated with seasonal environments. We present a geometric model distinguishing qualitative constraint, quantitative constraint and ‘pseudo-constraint’ whereby nutrient intakes resemble response to qualitative resource constraint but are in fact driven by variation in nutrient requirements. The model is applied to analyse nutrient intakes recorded in 164 full-day observations of monkeys from two populations, one wild and the other captive, across seasons. Additionally, we recorded the diet of a single animal over 32 consecutive days in the wild. Despite considerable differences in available resources, the captive and wild populations showed marked similarities in nutrient intakes, including indistinguishable amounts and ratios of ingested macronutrients during summer and autumn and strong year-round maintenance of protein compared to seasonally variable fat and carbohydrate intakes. These similarities suggest homeostatically regulated nutritional targets and provide reference points to identify factors driving population differences in macronutrient intake in winter and spring. Our framework enabled us to distinguish examples of quantitative, qualitative and ‘pseudo-constraint’. We suggest that this approach can increase the resolution at which resource constraint is conceptualized and measured in ecological studies.},

We suggest that the distinctive feature of nutritional ecology is its integrative nature, and that the field would benefit from more attention to formalizing a theoretical and quantitative framework for developing this. 3. Such a framework, we propose, should satisfy three minimal requirements: it should be nutritionally explicit, organismally explicit, and ecologically explicit. 4. We evaluate against these criteria four existing frameworks (Optimal Foraging Theory, Classical Insect Nutritional Ecology, the Geometric Framework for nutrition, and Ecological Stoichiometry), and conclude that each needs development with respect to at least one criterion. 5. We end with an initial attempt at assessing the expansion of our own contribution, the Geometric Framework, to better satisfy the criterion of ecological explicitness.},

Similar observations were made on two troops of red colobus and two of black and white colobus (C. guereza uellensis) in Kibale Forest Reserve, Uganda, between August and October 1970. The red colobus at Gombe were highly selective in their choice of food, feeding on the leaves, shoots, flowers and fruit of a wide variety of tree species. The animals appeared to choose a varied diet, eating different foods in different feeding bouts on the same day. The amount of time which they spent feeding on different foods varied seasonally, usually in association with changes in food availability. Different parts of the animals’ range provided them with different kinds of food. The feeding behaviour of the red colobus troops at Kibale was similar to that of the Gombe troop. In contrast, black and white colobus at Kibale fed almost exclusively on mature leaves during at least one period of the year and fed largely on two tree species only. These differences in feeding behaviour may explain why red colobus live in large troops in large ranges while black and white colobus live in small troops in small ranges.},

We identified 11,153 canopy disturbances greater than 25 m2 in area, including treefalls, large branchfalls and standing dead trees, affecting 1.9\% of area per year. Soil type, forest age and topography explained up to 46\%–67\% of disturbance rate variation at spatial grains of 58–64 ha, with higher rates in older forests, steeper slopes and local depressions. Furthermore, disturbance rates predicted the proportion of low canopy area across the landscape, and mean canopy height in old growth forests.

In many contexts, edge weights are inferred from observational data, and the uncertainty around point estimates can be affected by various factors. Though this has been acknowledged in previous work, methods that explicitly quantify uncertainty in edge weights have not yet been widely adopted, and remain undeveloped for common types of data. Furthermore, existing methods are unable to cope with some of the complexities often found in observational data, and do not propagate uncertainty in edge weights to subsequent analyses. We introduce a uniﬁed Bayesian framework for modelling social networks based on observational data. This framework, which we call BISoN, can accommodate many common types of observational social data, can capture confounds and model effects at the level of observations, and is fully compatible with popular methods of social network analysis. We show how the framework can be applied to common types of data and how various types of downstream analyses can be performed, including non-random association tests and regressions on network properties. Our framework opens up the opportunity to test new types of hypotheses, make full use of observational datasets, and increase the reliability of scientiﬁc inferences. We have made example R code available to enable adoption of the framework.},

	abstract = {Many factors influence the evolution of primate grouping patterns, including phylogeny, demographic and life-history variables, and ecological factors such as access to food, predation pressure, and avoidance of infanticide. The interaction between these factors determines social organization.1 Because western lowland and mountain gorillas differ so dramatically in their habitats and foraging strategies, they provide a valuable opportunity to assess how changes in ecology influence this balance. Mountain gorillas live in high-altitude montane forests, are herbivorous, and live in stable and cohesive groups. Western lowland gorillas live in lowland rainforest and are much more frugivorous than mountain gorillas. It is not yet clear to what extent incorporating significant quantities of fruit in the diet influences western lowland gorilla sociality because they have been studied much less than have mountain gorillas. However, what is known about their behavior hints that there may also be considerable differences in their social organization, including changes in group size and cohesion and in the frequency and type of intergroup encounters. Gorillas thus provide a unique opportunity to reevaluate proposed models of ecological influences on social organization in African apes.© 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Due to their male philopatry, the need for cooperation in home range defence and high degree of fission–fusion dynamics, spider monkeys provide an opportunity to investigate how male–male interactions are associated with socio-ecological factors, such as the presence of potentially receptive females, the degree of food availability and the likelihood of home range defence. We tested predictions about changes in social interactions between wild spider monkey males in relation to these factors. First, males did not change their interaction patterns when potentially receptive females were in the subgroup compared to when they were absent. Second, males tended to be less tolerant of one another when feeding, but spent more time grooming, in contact and proximity with one another when food availability was lower than when it was higher. Third, males exchanged fewer embraces, spent less time grooming, in proximity and in contact with one another, and spent more time vigilant at the home range boundary area than at other locations. Our findings contribute to the understanding of social flexibility and the importance of considering males in socio-ecological models of any group-living species.},

However, linking individual behavior during group decision-making to the preferences underlying those actions poses a considerable challenge. Optimal foraging theory, and specifically the marginal value theorem (MVT), can provide predictions about individual preferences, against which the behavior of groups can be compared under different models of influence. A major strength of formally linking optimal foraging theory to collective behavior is that it generates predictions that can easily be tested under field conditions. This opens the door to studying group decision-making in a range of species; a necessary step for revealing the ecological drivers and evolutionary consequences of collective decision-making.},

Previously proposed methods using airborne and hyperspectral sensors can identify tree species with high accuracy but are costly and are thus unsuitable for small-scale forest managers. In this work, we constructed a machine vision system for tree identification and mapping using Red–Green–Blue (RGB) image taken by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this system, we first calculated the slope from the three-dimensional model obtained by the UAV, and segmented the UAV RGB photograph of the forest into several tree crown objects automatically using colour and three-dimensional information and the slope model, and lastly applied object-based CNN classification for each crown image. This system succeeded in classifying seven tree classes, including several tree species with more than 90\% accuracy. The guided gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Guided Grad-CAM) showed that the CNN classified trees according to their shapes and leaf contrasts, which enhances the potential of the system for classifying individual trees with similar colours in a cost-effective manner—a useful feature for forest management.},

The delineation of individual trees in remote sensing images is an essential task in forest analysis. Here we introduce a new Python package, DeepForest that detects individual trees in high resolution RGB imagery using deep learning. While deep learning has proven highly effective in a range of computer vision tasks, it requires large amounts of training data that are typically difficult to obtain in ecological studies. DeepForest overcomes this limitation by including a model pretrained on over 30 million algorithmically generated crowns from 22 forests and fine-tuned using 10,000 hand-labelled crowns from six forests. The package supports the application of this general model to new data, fine tuning the model to new datasets with user labelled crowns, training new models and evaluating model predictions. This simplifies the process of using and retraining deep learning models for a range of forests, sensors and spatial resolutions. We illustrate the workflow of DeepForest using data from the National Ecological Observatory Network, a tropical forest in French Guiana, and street trees from Portland, Oregon.},

Individuals were highly site-faithful between days: 32.5\% of the time males returned to the same oviposition site, and 62.3\% of the time males returned to within 3 m of their previous site. Mating success on the pond was temporally predictable and spatially variable. As the model predicted from these habitat characteristics, individuals were more likely to be site-faithful if they had obtained a mating at the site the day before, if their territory was of relatively high quality and when they were older. Males that voluntarily changed oviposition sites between days moved to higher-quality territories. In contrast to some other odonate and avian studies, territory evictions caused considerable site infidelity in amberwings both within and between days. Evictions caused most moves within a day, but the majority of moves between days were voluntary.},

	abstract = {Site fidelity, the tendency to return to a previously occupied location, has been observed in numerous species belonging to at least three phyla. In this paper I develop a general model using dynamic programming to investigate conditions under which fidelity to a previously occupied territory will be advantageous. The results predict that site fidelity should be inversely related to heterogeneity in territory quality and the animal's lifespan and positively related to the cost of changing territories, age and probability of mortality in the habitat. The predictability of reproductive outcome (defined as the probability that next period's outcome will be the same as this period's outcome) also affects site fidelity. In predictable habitats, changing territories may be favoured after a bad previous outcome. In contrast, settlement should be independent of the previous outcome in unpredictable habitats. Individuals should also be site-faithful in unpredictable habitats, as long as the mean territory quality is equal among available territories. I also investigate the success of two potential decision rules (‘always stay’ and ‘win-stay: lose-switch’) relative to the optimal settlement strategy. The results show that these rules may perform as well as the optimal strategy under certain conditions. The always stay strategy does well in unpredictable habitats, when the mean quality within a territory is equal among territories. In contrast, the win-stay: lose-switch strategy performs best in predictable habitats.},

Concurrently, we monitored shifts in home range by individual females and subadult and adult males. We documented home range stability by calculating the area of overlap in successive years, and by recording the drift of each group’s monthly centroid from its initial location. Home ranges remained stable for 3 of our 4 groups (overlap over 10 yr {\textgreater}60\%). Core areas were more labile, but group centroids drifted an average of only 530 m over the entire decade. Deviations from site fidelity were associated with dispersal or group fission. During natal dispersal, subadult males expanded their home ranges over many months, settling ≤4 home ranges away. Adult males, in contrast, typically dispersed within a few days to an adjacent group in an area of home range overlap. Adult males made solitary forays, but nearly always into areas used by their current group or by a group to which they had previously belonged. After secondary dispersal, they expanded their ranging in the company of their new group, apparently without prior solitary exploration of the new area. Some females also participated in home range shifts. Females shifted home ranges only within social groups, in association with temporary or permanent group splits. Our observations raise the possibility that male mangabeys use a finder-joiner mechanism when moving into new home ranges during secondary dispersal. Similarly, females might learn new resource locations from male immigrants before or during group fission.},

	abstract = {Territoriality and stable home ranges are a common space-use pattern among animals. These ranges provide its inhabitants with important resources and thus favourable territories are associated with an increased fitness. While the role of territory quality and changes of territory ownership have often been investigated, the changes of territorial boundaries have been less studied. Here, we investigated space-use changes in a social mammal species, applying a novel analytical approach, calculating long-term dissimilarity in space use using distancematrices based on periodic utilization distributions. This approach makes it possible to identify different space-use patterns, which cannot be distinguished by only considering changes between consecutive time periods. We analysed meerkat (Suricata suricatta) movements of a total of 24 different groups over a 16-year period, resulting in 134 group years. We then correlated the identified home-range changes to life-history events and possible environmental drivers. Groups had stable territories for several years before they abandoned their home range mostly to move quickly to new areas where they again remained for several years. Of 26 identified sudden shifts, 22 occurred in the summer months and often involved distances larger than the original home-range size. Home-range movements that were close together in time were often also spatially clustered and moved in a similar direction. These shifts were often preceded by more frequent interactions between groups, but did not seem to be a product of direct displacements by other groups. The normalized difference vegetation index as a measure of food production and social factors such as dominance changes did not correlate to changes. Against our expectation space-use changes were not accumulations of small changes, but more often involved long-distance moves into unknown ranges. This means that the groups enter areas where they cannot profit from local knowledge. The methods used identify episodes of long stability alternated by sudden changes in meerkats and in general provides insight into long-term space use. Our methods can be used to analyse long-term space use, either within or across species.},

	abstract = {Space use by animals can provide insight into the habitats in which they live. In predictable landscapes where high-quality habitat is distributed heterogeneously, fidelity can increase individual fitness because animals benefit from familiarity. We tested the hypothesis that space use and the level of site fidelity will reflect habitat productivity and the spatiotemporal distribution of resources. To test our hypothesis we examined site fidelity in 41 grizzly bears, Ursus arctos, during 2003–2006 in the Mackenzie Delta, in Canada's Arctic. We estimated annual home range size for males (x¯=1215km2) and females (x¯=680km2) using the 95\% fixed kernel approach. We used three methods to examine the level of home range fidelity in consecutive years. Bear locations were largely spatially nonoverlapping between years, which represented a pattern of both low site and home range fidelity. Although distances between home range centres were small for both males (x¯=7.7km) and females (x¯=8.4km), mean percentage overlap was only 24.2\%. Our observations suggest that bears remain philopatric to a region, however, position and configuration of the annual range drifts over time. The low fidelity that we observed suggests an adaptive strategy of space use for low-density populations in regions of low productivity where quality habitats are spatially and temporally heterogeneous. We suggest that traditional definitions of a home range may be too limited for Arctic grizzlies and propose that the multiannual home range is a more meaningful measure for describing space use.},

Ten troops derived from known fissions have settled in parts of their parent troop range or an adjacent neighbor's range. Five more troops may derive from similar matrilocal fissioning, inferred from behavior and ranging patterns. One has remained unchanged. Five have unknown parentage, in the ranges of four previously censused troops. Once a fissioned troop completely replaced another, one troop permanently extended its range, three times females joined a different troop, once a female remained nomadic for two years without stable home range. No fissioned troop has been seen to leapfrog others: to settle discontiuously from its parent. Intertroop antagonism may reflect benefits of long-term core area control.},

	abstract = {A decline in the density of trees and the deterioration of the habitat of vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, have been accompanied by movement of vervet groups into unfamiliar areas. These home range shifts were documented over a period of 26 months. The largest group moved into the home ranges of neighboring groups and acquired more trees, a resource that had become more limited. The groups whose home ranges were encroached upon did not share their home ranges with the intruders, but instead moved into areas that were unoccupied and had a lower density of trees. The largest group was thus more successful than smaller groups in competition for limited resources. For all but one group, movement into new areas was directly associated with the disappearances of female and immature monkeys. Most of the disappearances were attributable to predation. These results suggest that the cost of predation in unfamiliar areas may contribute to the evolution of philopatry in vervets. However, under unstable conditions, resource competition forces these animals to disperse (in groups) despite the high risk of predation.},

	abstract = {Many animals undertake movements that are longer scaled and more directed than their typical home ranging behaviour. These movements include seasonal migrations (e.g. between breeding and feeding grounds), natal dispersal, nomadic range shifts and responses to local environmental disruptions. While various heuristic tools exist for identifying range shifts and migrations, none explicitly model the movement of the animals within a statistical framework that facilitates quantitative comparisons. We present the mechanistic range shift analysis (MRSA), a method to estimate a suite of range shift parameters: times of initiation, duration of transitions, centroids and areas of respective ranges. The method can take the autocorrelation and irregular sampling that is characteristic of much movement data into account. The mechanistic parameters suggest an intuitive measure, the range shift index, for the extent of a range shift. The likelihood based estimation further allows for statistical tests of several relevant hypotheses, including a range shift test, a stopover test and a site fidelity test. The analysis tools are provided in an R package (marcher). We applied the MRSA to a population of GPS tracked roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in the Italian Alps between 2005 and 2008. With respect to seasonal migration, this population is extremely variable and difficult to classify. Using the MRSA, we were able to quantify the behaviours across the population and among individuals across years, identifying extents, durations and locations of seasonal range shifts, including cases that would have been ambiguous to detect using existing tools. The strongest patterns were differences across years: many animals simply did not perform a seasonal migration to wintering grounds during the mild winter of 2006–2007, even though some of these same animals did move extensively in other, harsher winters. For seasonal migrants, however, site fidelity across years was extremely high, even after skipping an entire seasonal migration. These results suggest that for roe deer behavioural plasticity and tactical responses to immediate environmental cues are reflected in the decision of whether rather than where to migrate. The MRSA also revealed a trade-off between the probability of migrating and the size of a home range.},

High-volume location data from global positioning system (GPS) technology provide researchers the opportunity to identify various intensities of use within home ranges, typically quantified through utilization distributions (UDs). However, the wide range of variability evident within UDs constructed with modern home range estimators is often overlooked or ignored during home range comparisons, and challenges may arise when summarizing distributional shifts among multiple UDs. We describe an approach to gain additional insight into home range changes by comparing UDs across isopleths and summarizing comparisons into meaningful results. To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, we used GPS location data from 16 bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) to identify distributional changes before and after habitat alterations, and we discuss advantages in its application when comparing home range size, overlap, and joint-space use. We found a consistent increase in bighorn sheep home range size when measured across home range levels, but that home range overlap and similarity values decreased when examined at increasing core levels. Our results highlight the benefit of conducting multiscale assessments when comparing distributions, and we encourage researchers to expand comparative home range analyses to gain a more comprehensive evaluation of distributional changes and to evaluate comparisons across home range levels.},

The current methods that calculate joint space use generally do not account for proximity in space use, as all of them rely on the differences between the exact spatial overlay of utilization distributions, while spatial distances between distributions should be considered to truly quantify similarity. We implemented the earth mover's distance (EMD), a spatially explicit method, that quantifies similarity between utilization distributions by calculating the effort it takes to shape one utilization distribution landscape into another, hence EMD. The EMD is a method commonly used in image retrieval applications, and we propose its use to calculate similarity in space use in the framework of movement ecology. We show that the EMD is a consistent and useful as well as versatile measure of overlap and provide an easy to use implementation in the r package move.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The concept of an animal's home range has evolved over time, as have methods for estimating home-range size and shape. Recently, home-range estimation methods have focused on estimating an animal's utilization distribution (UD; i.e., the probability distribution defining the animal's use of space). We illustrate the importance of the utilization distribution in characterizing the degree of overlap between home ranges (e.g., when assessing site fidelity or space-use sharing among individuals). We compare several different statistics for their ability to accurately rank paired examples in terms of their degree of overlap. These examples illustrate limitations of indices commonly used to quantify home-range overlap and suggest that new overlap indices that are a function of the UD are likely to be more informative. We suggest 2 new statistics for measuring home-range overlap: (1) for a measure of space-use sharing, we suggest a generalization of Hurlbert's (1978) E/Euniform statistic, which we term the utilization distribution overlap index (UDOI), and (2) for a general measure of similarity between UD estimates, we suggest Bhattacharyya's affinity (BA; Bhattacharyya 1943). Using a short simulation study, we found that overlap indices can accurately rank pairs of UDs in terms of the extent of overlap, but estimates of overlap indices are likely to be biased. The extent of the bias depended on sample size and the degree of overlap (UDs with a high degree of overlap resulted in statistics that were more biased [low]), suggesting that comparisons across studies may be problematic. We illustrate the use of overlap indices to quantify the degree of similarity among UD estimates obtained using 2 different data collection methods (Global Positioning Systems [GPS] and very high frequency [VHF] radiotelemetry) for an adult female northern white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in north-central Minnesota.},

	abstract = {Movement ecology has developed rapidly over the past decade, driven by advances in tracking technology that have largely removed data limitations. Development of rigorous analytical tools has lagged behind empirical progress, and as a result, relocation data sets have been underutilized. Discrete-time correlated random walk models (CRW) have long served as the foundation for analyzing relocation data. Unfortunately, CRWs confound the sampling and movement processes. CRW parameter estimates thus depend sensitively on the sampling schedule, which makes it difficult to draw sampling-independent inferences about the underlying movement process. Furthermore, CRWs cannot accommodate the multiscale autocorrelations that typify modern, finely sampled relocation data sets. Recent developments in modelling movement as a continuous-time stochastic process (CTSP) solve these problems, but the mathematical difficulty of using CTSPs has limited their adoption in ecology. To remove this roadblock, we introduce the ctmm package for the R statistical computing environment. ctmm implements all of the CTSPs currently in use in the ecological literature and couples them with powerful statistical methods for autocorrelated data adapted from geostatistics and signal processing, including variograms, periodograms and non-Markovian maximum likelihood estimation. ctmm is built around a standard workflow that begins with visual diagnostics, proceeds to candidate model identification, and then to maximum likelihood fitting and AIC-based model selection. Once an accurate CTSP for the data has been fitted and selected, analyses that require such a model, such as quantifying home range areas via autocorrelated kernel density estimation or estimating occurrence distributions via time-series Kriging, can then be performed. We use a case study with African buffalo to demonstrate the capabilities of ctmm and highlight the steps of a typical CTSP movement analysis workflow.},

	abstract = {Animals are hypothesized to search their environments in predictable ways depending on the distribution of resources. Evenly distributed foods are thought to be best exploited with random Brownian movements; while foods that are patchy or unevenly distributed require non-Brownian strategies, such as Lévy walks. Thus, when food distribution changes due to seasonal variation, animals should show concomitant changes in their search strategies. We examined this issue in 6 monkey species from Africa and Mexico: 3 frugivores and 3 folivores. We hypothesized that the more patchily distributed fruit would result in frugivores showing more levy-like patterns of motion, while folivores, with their more homogenous food supply, would show Brownian patterns of motion. At least 3 and up to 5 of 6 species conformed to the overall movement pattern predicted by their primary dietary item. For folivorous black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra), ursine colobus (Colobus vellerosus), and red colobus (Procolobus rufomitratus), Brownian movement was supported or could not be ruled-out. Two frugivores (spider monkeys, Ateles geoffroyi yucatanensis, and gray-cheeked mangabeys, Lophocebus albigena) showed Lévy walks, as predicted, but frugivorous vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) showed a Brownian walk. Additionally, we test whether seasonal variation in the spatial availability of food support environmentally driven changes in movement patterns. Four of 5 species tested for seasonal variation showed adjustments in their search strategies between the rainy and dry seasons. This study provides support for the notion that food distribution determines search strategies and that animal movement patterns are flexible, mirroring changes in the environment.},

The machine was able to drive between maize rows and collect concurrent time-stamped data. A robotic total station tracked the position of a prism mounted on the vehicle. The total station and laser scanner data were fused to generate a three dimensional (3D) point cloud. This 3D representation was used to detect individual plant positions, which are of particular interest for applications such as phenotyping, individual plant treatment and precision weeding. Two different methodologies were applied to the 3D point cloud to estimate the position of the individual plants. The first methodology used the Euclidian Clustering on the entire point cloud. The second methodology utilised the position of an initial plant and the fixed plant spacing to search iteratively for the best clusters. The two algorithms were applied at three different plant growth stages. For the first method, results indicated a detection rate up to 73.7\% with a root mean square error of 3.6 cm. The second method was able to detect all plants (100\% detection rate) with an accuracy of 2.7–3.0 cm, taking the plant spacing of 13 cm into account.},

	abstract = {Understanding the determinants of tropical forest tree richness and spatial distribution is a central goal of forest ecology; however, the role of herbivorous mammals has received little attention. Here we explore the potential for red colobus monkeys (Procolobus rufomitratus) to influence the abundance of Markhamia lutea trees in a tropical forest by feeding extensively on the tree’s flowers, such that this tree population is not able to regularly set fruit. Using 14years of data from Kibale National Park, Uganda, we quantify M. lutea flower and fruit production. Similarly, using 21years of data, we quantify temporal changes in the abundance of stems in size classes from 1m tall and above. Our analyses demonstrate that M. lutea is rarely able to produce fruit and that this corresponds to a general decline in its abundance across all size classes. Moreover, using 7years of feeding records, we demonstrate that red colobus feed on M. lutea, consuming large amounts of leaf and flower buds whenever they were available, suggesting that this behavior limits fruit production. Therefore, we suggest that red colobus are presently important for structuring the distribution and abundance of M. lutea in Kibale. This dynamic raises the intriguing question of how a large M. lutea population was able to originally establish. There is no evidence of a change in red colobus population size; however, if this old-growth forest is in a non-equilibrium state, M. lutea may have become established when red colobus ate a different diet.},

	abstract = {Parks are essential for protecting biodiversity and finding ways to improve park effectiveness is an important topic. We contributed to this debate by examining spatial and temporal changes in illegal activities in Kibale National Park, Uganda between 2006 and 2016 and used existing data to evaluate how the changes were correlated with the living conditions of people in neighboring communities, as well as patrolling effort. We explore the effectiveness of conservation strategies implemented in Kibale, by quantifying changes in the abundance of nine animal species over two to five decades. While uncertainty in such animal survey data are inherently large and it is hard to generalize across a 795-km2 area that encompasses diverse habitat types, data suggest an increase in animal abundance in the National Park. An increase in patrolling effort by park guards over the decade was correlated with a decline in the number of traps and snares found, which suggests patrolling helped limit resource extraction from the park. The park’s edge was extensively used for illegal forest product extraction, while the setting of snares occurred more often deeper in the forest. Perhaps counter-intuitively, increased community wealth or park-related employment in a village next to the park were positively correlated with increased illegal forest product extraction. Overall, our results suggest that the portfolio of conservation strategies used over the last two to five decades were effective for protecting the park and its animals, although understanding the impact of these efforts on local human populations and how to mitigate any losses and suffering they sustain remains an important area of research and action. It is evident that complex social, political and economic drivers impact conservation success and more interdisciplinary studies are required to quantify and qualify these dimensions.},

	abstract = {A series of articles by W.J. Freeland published in the 1970s proposed that social organization and behavioral processes were heavily influenced by parasitic infections, which led to a number of intriguing hypotheses concerning how natural selection might act on social factors because of the benefits of avoiding parasite infections. For example, Freeland [1979] showed that all individuals within a given group harbored identical gastrointestinal protozoan faunas, which led him to postulate that social groups were akin to “biological islands” and suggest how this isolation could select specific types of ranging and dispersal patterns. Here, we reexamine the biological island hypothesis by quantifying the protozoan faunas of the same primate species examined by Freeland in the same location; our results do not support this hypothesis. In contrast, we quantified two general changes in protozoan parasite community of primates in the study area of Kibale National Park, Uganda, over the nearly 35 years between sample collections: (1) the colobines found free of parasites in the early 1970s are now infected with numerous intestinal protozoan parasites and (2) groups are no longer biological islands in terms of their protozoan parasites. Whatever the ultimate explanation for these changes, our findings have implications for studies proposing selective forces shaping primate behavior and social organization. Am. J.

	abstract = {Very little information exists on mineral nutrition of tropical, forest-dwelling species, yet minerals are critical to growth, reproduction, and survival. We examined the mineral resources available to and consumed by colobus in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We combined behavioral data on black-and-white (Colobus guereza) and red colobus (Piliocolobus tephrosceles) in a section of unlogged forest, a heavily logged area, and a forest fragment with mineral analysis of their foods to estimate the proportion of the diet containing specific minerals (mineral content). We compared mineral content of colobus foods (natural and crops) across plant parts and among plant species. Additionally, we estimated mineral intake of frugivorous primates in Kibale from published dietary data and our estimates of mineral content of foods. Dietary mineral content for all colobus groups and frugivorous species is similar despite significant differences in the mineral content of foods. Ripe and unripe fruits are lower in mineral content than most foods. Foods rarely consumed, such as bark, petioles, and caterpillars have high levels of some minerals. The mineral content of crops is low in comparison to that ofnatural foods. For all colobus groups of both species, sodium content of foods was extremely low and iron content was generally low, suggesting that intake isbelow suggested requirements, though current suggested iron requirements may overestimate physiological needs. Copper content was marginal and deficient seasonally for most colobus groups. Despite a sodium-limiting environment, only one of 8 colobus groups appeared to select sodium; however, this may be due to a lack of variation in sodium content among plant species and a positive correlation between high plant sodium content and secondary compounds. Despite the lack of selection for sodium by colobines, some behaviors point to a potential sodium deficiency, including urine drinking, consumption of high-sodium swamp plants, and use of mud-puddles.},

	abstract = {Examining seasonal mortality patterns can yield insights into the drivers of mortality and thus potential selection pressures acting on individuals in different environments. We compiled adult and juvenile mortality data from nine wild non-human primate taxa to investigate the role of seasonality in patterns of mortality and address the following questions: Is mortality highly seasonal across species? Does greater environmental seasonality lead to more seasonal mortality patterns? If mortality is seasonal, is it higher during wet seasons or during periods of food scarcity? and Do folivores show less seasonal mortality than frugivores? We found seasonal mortality patterns in five of nine taxa, and mortality was more often tied to wet seasons than food-scarce periods, a relationship that may be driven by disease. Controlling for phylogeny, we found a positive relationship between the degree of environmental seasonality and mortality, with folivores exhibiting more seasonal mortality than frugivores. These results suggest that mortality patterns are influenced both by diet and degree of environmental seasonality. Applied to a wider array of taxa, analyses of seasonal mortality patterns may aid understanding of life-history evolution and selection pressures acting across a broad spectrum of environments and spatial and temporal scales.},

	abstract = {Even when hunting in groups is mutually beneficial, it is unclear how communal hunts are initiated. If it is costly to be the only hunter, individuals should be reluctant to hunt unless others already are. We used 70 years of data from three communities to examine how male chimpanzees ‘solve’ this apparent collective action problem. The ‘impact hunter’ hypothesis proposes that group hunts are sometimes catalysed by certain individuals that hunt more readily than others. In two communities (Kasekela and Kanyawara), we identified a total of five males that exhibited high hunt participation rates for their age, and whose presence at an encounter with red colobus monkeys increased group hunting probability. Critically, these impact hunters were observed to hunt first more often than expected by chance. We argue that by hunting first, these males dilute prey defences and create opportunities for previously reluctant participants. This by-product mutualism can explain variation in group hunting rates within and between social groups. Hunting rates declined after the death of impact hunter FG in Kasekela and after impact hunter MS stopped hunting frequently in Kanyawara. There were no impact hunters in the third, smaller community (Mitumba), where, unlike the others, hunting probability increased with the number of females present at an encounter with prey.},

	abstract = {Predation can have major effects on vertebrate population dynamics, including predator–prey cycles that occur on multiple time scales when predators switch between preferred and alternative prey and changes in the abundance of preferred prey when the availability of alternative prey changes. Predation has been an important selective force in primate social evolution and may regulate some primate populations, but assessing its impact is often difficult. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) provide opportunities for direct collection of data on predation intensity by following habituated predators because they regularly prey on a variety of vertebrates, including other primates. Chimpanzees mostly hunt red colobus monkeys (Procolobus spp.) wherever they live in sympatry. Previous reports have documented heavy predation on red colobus by chimpanzees in the unusually large Ngogo community, in Kibale National Park, Uganda, and have shown an apparent decline in the local red colobus population. Here, we update information on predation at Ngogo, give further evidence of a red colobus population decline, and ask whether the chimpanzees have made more effort to hunt alternative prey in response. Data collected between 1995 and 2014 show that the rate of alternative prey hunts has increased significantly, while the rate of red colobus hunts has declined. Predation on red colobus peaked in 2002; other prey have since accounted for significantly higher proportions of hunts and prey captures. The overall hunting rate has not changed significantly, but per capita meat availability has decreased because hunts of alternative prey lead to fewer captures than hunts of red colobus. The likelihood that the chimpanzees hunt red colobus on encounter has not changed significantly. In contrast, the likelihood of hunting on encounter has increased (redtail monkeys, Cercopithecus ascanius; gray-cheeked mangabeys, Lophocebus albigena) or remained stable (guerezas, Colobus guereza) for other primates that are major alternative prey species. Encounter rates have not changed for redtails and mangabeys, but the guereza encounter rate has decreased. These results imply that the red colobus population is not recovering and raise the possibility that the chimpanzees are having a negative impact on the guereza population. Chimpanzees are not obligate carnivores, but this may make them prone to cause such impacts because their own populations are probably not limited by those of their prey.},

	abstract = {Despite the routine nature of estimating overlapping space use in ecological research, to date no formal inferential framework for home range overlap has been available to ecologists. Part of this issue is due to the inherent difficulty of comparing the estimated home ranges that underpin overlap across individuals, studies, sites, species, and times. As overlap is calculated conditionally on a pair of home range estimates, biases in these estimates will propagate into biases in overlap estimates. Further compounding the issue of comparability in home range estimators is the historical lack of confidence intervals on overlap estimates. This means that it is not currently possible to determine if a set of overlap values is statistically different from one another. As a solution, we develop the first rigorous inferential framework for home range overlap. Our framework is based on the autocorrelated-Kernel density estimation (AKDE) family of home range estimators, which correct for biases due to autocorrelation, small effective sample size, and irregular sampling in time. Collectively, these advances allow AKDE estimates to validly be compared even when sampling strategies differ. We then couple the AKDE estimates with a novel bias-corrected Bhattacharyya coefficient (BC) to quantify overlap. Finally, we propagate uncertainty in the AKDE estimates through to overlap and thus are able to put confidence intervals on the BC point estimate. Using simulated data, we demonstrate how our inferential framework provides accurate overlap estimates, and reasonable coverage of the true overlap, even at small sample sizes. When applied to empirical data, we found that building an interaction network for Mongolian gazelles Procapra gutturosa based on all possible ties, vs. only those ties with statistical support, substantially influenced the network’s properties and any potential biological inferences derived from it. Our inferential framework permits researchers to calculate overlap estimates that can validly be compared across studies, sites, species, and times, and test whether observed differences are statistically meaningful.

	abstract = {Migrating grazers and carnivores respond to seasonal changes in the environment and often match peaks in resource abundance. However, it is unclear whether and how frugivorous animals use phenological events to time migration, especially in the tropics. The straw-coloured fruit bat Eidolon helvum, Africa's most gregarious fruit bat, forms large seasonal colonies throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa. We hypothesized that aggregations of E. helvum match the timing of their migration with phenologies of plant growth or precipitation. Using monthly colony counts from across much of the species' range, we matched peak colony size to landscape phenologies and explored the variation among colonies matching the overall closest phenological event. Peak colony size was closest to the peak instantaneous rate of green-up, and sites with closer temporal matching were associated with higher maximum greenness, short growing season and larger peak colony size. Eidolon helvum seem to time their migrations to move into highly seasonal landscapes to exploit short-lived explosions of food and may benefit from collective sensing to time migrations. The link between rapid changes in colony size and phenological match may also imply potential collective sensing of the environment. Overall decreasing bat numbers along with various threats might cause this property of large colonies to be lost. Remote sensing data, although, indirectly linked to fruiting events, can potentially be used to globally describe and predict the migration of frugivorous species in a changing world.

	abstract = {One main goal of argumentation theory is to evaluate arguments and to determine whether they should be accepted or rejected. When there is no clear answer, a third option, being undecided, has to be taken into account. Indecision is often not considered explicitly, but rather taken to be a collection of all unclear or troubling cases. However, current philosophy makes a strong point for taking indecision itself to be a proper object of consideration. This paper aims at revealing parallels between the findings concerning indecision in philosophy and the treatment of indecision in argumentation theory. By investigating what philosophical forms and norms of indecision are involved in argumentation theory, we can improve our understanding of the different uncertain evidential situations in argumentation theory.},

This behavior should be avoided in many decision support applications, where mistakes can have severe consequences. Albeit already studied in 1970, machine learning with a reject option recently gained interest. This machine learning subfield enables machine learning models to abstain from making a prediction when likely to make a mistake. This survey aims to provide an overview on machine learning with a reject option. We introduce the conditions leading to two types of rejection, ambiguity and novelty rejection. Moreover, we define the existing architectures for models with a reject option, describe the standard learning strategies to train such models and relate traditional machine learning techniques to rejection. Additionally, we review strategies to evaluate a model's predictive and rejective quality. Finally, we provide examples of relevant application domains and show how machine learning with rejection relates to other machine learning research areas.},

However, the quantification and communication of uncertainty for individual predictions is often neglected even though uncertainty estimates could lead to more principled decision-making and enable machine learning models to automatically or semi-automatically abstain on samples for which there is high uncertainty. In this article, we provide an overview of different approaches to uncertainty quantification and abstention for machine learning and highlight how these techniques could improve the safety and reliability of current ML systems being used in healthcare settings. Effective quantification and communication of uncertainty could help to engender trust with healthcare workers, while providing safeguards against known failure modes of current machine learning approaches. As machine learning becomes further integrated into healthcare environments, the ability to say “I’m not sure” or “I don’t know” when uncertain is a necessary capability to enable safe clinical deployment.},

I will illustrate that this notion is expected to capture various aspects that are not easily unified: while some aspects are more about the agent in a certain situation, other aspects seem to be more about the situation as such. As a consequence, incompatible intuitions emerge about the transparency of epistemic dilemmas and about the role doxastic suspension may play in resolving dilemmic cases. I suggest a distinction between the mental state of agents who find themselves in an epistemic dilemma and the normative situation that gives rise to a dilemma. I will refer to the agent’s mental state as “epistemic conflict” and will reserve the term “epistemic dilemma” for evidential situations in which epistemic principles either recommend incompatible doxastic responses or render all options impermissible. The concept of epistemic conflict also applies to agents who face difficult epistemic choices that they cannot resolve without substantial mental effort, for example, via doxastic suspension.},

I will argue that agnosticism is a complex mental state, and that the formation of an attitude is the relevant act or event by which a subject commits to indecision regarding some matter. I will suggest a ‘two-component analysis’ that addresses two aspects that jointly account for the settled state of agnosticism: (1) the subject’s de facto indecision and (2) the subject’s commitment to her indecision. Unlike meta-cognitivist or sui generis accounts, I do not take the agnostic’s commitment to indecision as constitutive for her indecision but rather as an evaluation or qualification of the indecision that she already exhibits. Agnosticism, thus, is a settled form of indecision that marks the end of inquiry.},

All animals have to offset risks of feeding such as exposure to plant toxins, increased vulnerability to predation, or conspecific aggression with a food's energetic and nutritional return. What, when, and where an individual eats can impact fitness and, ultimately, species-level adaptations. Here, we explore the variables that influence primate feeding preference: food availability, chemical defense, and nutrient content. We present information demonstrating that consumers manipulate nutrient and energy intake, indicating that what may be a less-than-optimal food for one state of an animal's phenotype may not be for another. This evidence suggests that factors previously assumed to be constraints in Optimal Foraging Theory, Functional Response, and—recently—Fallback Food feeding models would be better categorized as variables. We conclude that “fallback” is not an intrinsic state of the food or the consumer and that this conclusion complicates the application of this concept to morphological features in the fossil record.},

The application of UAS multi-season images to classify tropical tree species is still poorly understood. In this study, we used RGB images from different seasons obtained by a low-cost UAS and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to map tree species in an Amazonian forest. In­ dividual tree crowns (ITC) were outlined in the UAS images and identified to the species level using forest in­ ventory data. The CNN model was trained with images obtained in February, May, August, and November. The classification accuracy in the rainy season (November and February) was higher than in the dry season (May and August). Fusing images from multiple seasons improved the average accuracy of tree species classification by up to 21.1 percentage points, reaching 90.5\%. The CNN model can learn species-specific phenological character­ istics that impact the classification accuracy, such as leaf fall in the dry season, which highlights its potential to discriminate species in various conditions. We produced high-quality individual tree crown maps of the species using a post-processing procedure. The combination of multi-season UAS images and CNNs has the potential to map tree species in the Amazon, providing valuable insights for forest management and conservation initiatives.},

The measures are distinguished by their ability to characterize the spatial, temporal, structural or spatiotemporal signatures of an ecosystem. Many of these measures have been adapted from disciplines such as physics and information theory that have a long history of quantifying complexity, however more work needs to be done to develop techniques adapted to ecological data.

Still, limited research has shown that single gorilla groups heavily used areas where food biomass and quality were relatively high and where they met daily nutritional needs with relatively low foraging effort. Also, ecological factors influenced solitary males less than groups with females. Long-term data on habitat use by multiple mountain gorilla social units and more extensive data on variation in food distribution, presented here, confirm that food distribution influences areal occupation densities across groups and over time. These data also confirm the group/solitary male distinction and show that food distribution became more important for one male once he acquired females. Groups used ≤25 km2, and inter-annual home range and core area overlap was often low. Annual home range and core area size varied considerably within groups and across years. It bore no simple relationship to group size and estimated group biomass. Core areas were biased samples of total home ranges and were relatively good foraging areas. One group abruptly shifted its home range in response to male mating competition. Home ranges of two others expanded from 1981 to 1987, though at a decreasing rate. Data on one such group, which varied considerably in size, are consistent with arguments that costs of scramble competition are low except in unusually large groups. Low site fidelity, low scramble costs, and high home range overlap should decrease the ecological costs of female transfer.},

	abstract = {In addition to environmental factors, social variables such as group size may play an important role in explaining primate ranging patterns. In this study we investigated range sizes, site fidelity, and range overlaps of owl monkeys (Aotus azarae) in Northern Argentina. We calculated the size of home range and core areas for 18 groups in our study area. For the six most intensively studied groups we tested whether precipitation as a crude proxy for food availability or group size had an influence on range size, assessed the degree of site fidelity by quantifying overlaps of annual ranges and core areas, and calculated the amount of range overlap between neighboring groups for each year. We used the kernel density estimation method to calculate home ranges as 90\% kernel and core areas as 50\% kernel. Home range size (mean ± SD) was 6.2 ha (± 1.8) and core area size 1.9 (± 0.6). Rainfall and group size were not statistically significant predictors of range sizes. Site fidelity was high, with a range overlap of 82\% (± 11) between consecutive years. Neighboring groups overlapped over 48\% (± 15) of the outer parts of their group ranges and 11\% (± 15) of their core areas. We found no evidence that larger groups occupy larger areas than smaller groups, suggesting that food availability might be above a critical threshold for owl monkeys so that larger groups do not need to extend their foraging areas to meet their energy requirements. Our findings indicate that ranges remain stable over several years as groups visit the same locations of fruit trees within their range. We showed that owl monkeys exhibit a considerable degree of range overlap. However, we suggest that this range overlap might be spatial rather than temporal, which maximizes access to clumped feeding resources in overlapping areas that are used at distinct times, while excluding other males from access to females in exclusively used areas.},

	abstract = {Space-use patterns are crucial to understanding the ecology, evolution, and conservation of primates, but detailed ranging data are scarce for many species, especially those in Southeast Asia. Researchers studying site fidelity to either home ranges or core areas have focused mainly on territorial species, whereas less information is available for non-territorial species. We analyzed the ranging patterns and site fidelity of one wild troop of northern pigtailed macaques over 16 months at different temporal scales. We used characteristic hull polygons in combination with spatial statistics to estimate home ranges and core areas. The total home range and core areas were 449 ha and 190 ha, respectively. Average daily path length was 2,246 m. The macaques showed a high defendabili--ty index according to the expected ranging of a non-territorial species in which movement does not theoretically permit the defense of a large territory. Overall, the study troop ranged more extensively than conspecific groups and closely related species studied elsewhere. These differences may reflect variable troop size, degree of terrestriality and habitat characteristics, but could also reflect methodological differences. The location, size and shape of home ranges and core areas, and extent of daily path lengths changed on a monthly basis resulting in low site fidelity between months. The macaques also showed clear shifts in the location of daily home ranges with low site fidelity scores between consecutive days. Daily home range and daily path length were related to seasonality, with greater values during the fruit-abundant period. Low site fidelity associated with lack of territoriality is consistent with macaques structuring their movement based on available food sources. However, ranging patterns and site fidelity can also be explained by macaques feeding on the move, a foraging strategy that hinders frequent and long visits to the same location.},

We evaluated the degree of site fidelity of two groups of spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) over a 10- and 13-year period, respectively, in the northeastern Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. We used the Local Convex Hull method to estimate yearly home ranges and core areas (defined as the 60\% probability contour) for the two groups. Home ranges varied from 7.7 to 49.6 ha and core areas varied from 3.1 to 9.2 ha. We evaluated the degree of site fidelity by quantifying the number of years in which different areas were used as either home ranges or core areas. Large tracts were used only as home ranges and only for a few years, whereas small areas were used as either core area or home range for the duration of the study. The sum of the yearly core areas coincided partially with the yearly home ranges, indicating that home ranges contain areas used intermittently. Home ranges, and especially core areas, contained a higher proportion of mature forest than the larger study site as a whole. Across years and only in one group, the size of core areas was positively correlated with the proportion of adult males in the group, while the size of home ranges was positively correlated with both the proportion of males and the number of tree species included in the diet. Our findings suggest that spider monkey home ranges are the result of a combination of long-term site fidelity and year-to-year use variation to enable exploration of new resources.},

The core area in which we find all sleeping trees and the trees from which the gibbons duet and the wider home range (HR) which has varying levels of overlap with neighbouring gibbon groups. The core area is strenously defended, with the wider HR being more of a shared area for neighbouring groups. We present ranging and movement data on four wild gibbon groups from January 2010 to July 2018. Global Positioning System (GPS) data were collected every 5 mins on habitauted groups in Sebangau, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia resulting in 35,521 waypoints. Gibbon home- and corerange sizes were calculated using 95\%, and 50\%, volume contours of kernel density estimates. Home-ranges ranged from 58.74–147.75 ha with a mean of 95.7 ± SD 37.75 ha, the highest of comparable Hylobates species. Core-range size ranged from 20.7–51.31 ha with a mean size of 31.7 ± SD 13.76 ha. Gibbons had consistant site fidelity for their home- and core ranges; percentage overlap ranged from 4.3 23.97\% with a mean 16.5 ± SD 8.65\% overlap in home-range area. Core ranges did not overlap with the exception of two groups, in which a 0.64 ha (2.69\%) overlap occurred. Unsurprisingly forest loss from fire does affect the location of the HR of the impacted group, but does not appear to affect adjacent groups, though more data are needed on this. Understanding the complex use of space of these territorial animals is important in assessing both carrying capacity for wild populations and understading how reintroduced gibbon pairs will establish their core and HR.},

We show that body size, basal metabolic rate and life history act as constraints on brain evolution and through this influence the coevolution of neocortex size and group size. However, they do not determine either of these variables, which appear to be locked in a tight coevolutionary system. We show that, within primates, this relationship is specific to the neocortex. Nonetheless, there are important constraints on brain evolution; we use path analysis to show that, in order to evolve a large neocortex, a species must first evolve a large brain to support that neocortex and this in turn requires adjustments in diet (to provide the energy needed) and life history (to allow sufficient time both for brain growth and for ‘software’ programming). We review a wider literature demonstrating a tight coevolutionary relationship between brain size and sociality in a range of mammalian taxa, but emphasize that the social brain hypothesis is not about the relationship between brain/neocortex size and group size per se; rather, it is about social complexity and we adduce evidence to support this. Finally, we consider the wider issue of how mammalian (and primate) brains evolve in order to localize the social effects.},

We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily ﬁtted using existing GAM software, the mgcv package in R. We also discuss computational and statistical issues with ﬁtting these models, and demonstrate how to ﬁt HGAMs on example data.

              Papio
              ) as a source of hypotheses about the ecology and behavior of early hominins (early human ancestors and their close relatives). This approach has undergone a resurgence in the last decade as a result of rapidly increasing knowledge from experimental and field studies of baboons and from archeological and paleontological studies of hominins. The result is a rich array of analogies, scenarios, and other stimuli to thought about the ecology and behavior of early hominins. The main intent here is to illustrate baboon perspectives on early hominins, with emphasis on recent developments. This begins with a discussion of baboons and hominins as we know them currently and explains the reasons for drawing comparisons between them. These include occupation of diverse environments, combination of arboreal and terrestrial capabilities, relatively large body size, and sexual dimorphism. The remainder of the paper illustrates the main points with a small number of examples drawn from diverse areas of interest: diet (grasses and fish), danger (leopards and crocodiles), social organization (troops and multilevel societies), social relationships (male–male, male–female, female–female), communication (possible foundations of language), cognition (use of social information, comparison of self to others), and bipedalism (a speculative developmental hypothesis about the neurological basis). The conclusion is optimistic about the future of baboon perspectives on early hominins.},

	abstract = {Human between-group interactions are highly variable, ranging from violent to tolerant and affiliative. Tolerance between groups is linked to our unique capacity for large-scale cooperation and cumulative culture, but its evolutionary origins are understudied. In chimpanzees, one of our closest living relatives, predominantly hostile between-group interactions impede cooperation and information flow across groups. In contrast, in our other closest living relative, the bonobo, tolerant between-group associations are observed. However, as these associations can be frequent and prolonged and involve social interactions that mirror those within groups, it is unclear whether these bonobos really do belong to separate groups. Alternatively, the bonobo grouping patterns may be homologous to observations from the large Ngogo chimpanzee community, where individuals form within-group neighborhoods despite sharing the same membership in the larger group. To characterize bonobo grouping patterns, we compare the social structure of the Kokolopori bonobos with the chimpanzee group of Ngogo. Using cluster analysis, we find temporally stable clusters only in bonobos. Despite the large spatial overlap and frequent interactions between the bonobo clusters, we identified significant association preference within but not between clusters and a unique space use of each cluster. Although bonobo associations are flexible (i.e., fission–fusion dynamics), cluster membership predicted the bonobo fission compositions and the spatial cohesion of individuals during encounters. These findings suggest the presence of a social system that combines clear in-group/out-group distinction and out-group tolerance in bonobos, offering a unique referential model for the evolution of tolerant between-group interactions in humans.},

	abstract = {Humans possess a perhaps unique type of culture among primates called cumulative culture. In this type of culture, behavioural forms cumulate changes over time, which increases their complexity and/or efﬁciency, eventually making these forms culture-dependent. As changes cumulate, culture-dependent forms become causally opaque, preventing the overall behavioural form from being acquired by individuals on their own; in other words, culture-dependent forms must be copied between individuals and across generations. Despite the importance of cumulative culture for understanding the evolutionary history of our species, how and when cumulative culture evolved is still debated. One of the challenges faced when addressing these questions is how to identify culture-dependent forms that result from cumulative cultural evolution. Here we propose a novel method to identify the most likely cases of culture-dependent forms. The ‘Method of Local Restriction’ is based on the premise that as culture-dependent forms are repeatedly transmitted via copying, these forms will unavoidably cumulate population-speciﬁc changes (due to copying error) and therefore must be expected to become locally restricted over time. When we applied this method to our closest living relatives, the great apes, we found that most known ape behavioural forms are not locally restricted (across domains and species) and thus are unlikely to be acquired via copying. Nevertheless, we found 25 locally restricted forms across species and domains, three of which appear to be locally unique (having been observed in a single population of a single species). Locally unique forms represent the best current candidates for culture-dependent forms in non-human great apes. Besides these rare exceptions, our results show that overall, ape cultures do not rely heavily on copying, as most ape behaviours appear across sites and/or species, rendering them unlikely to be culture-dependent forms resulting from cumulative cultural evolution. Yet, the locally restricted forms (and especially the three locally unique forms) identiﬁed by our method should be tested further for their potential reliance on copying social learning mechanisms (and in turn, for their potential culture-dependence). Future studies could use the Method of Local Restriction to investigate the existence of culture-dependent forms in other animal species and in the hominin archaeological record to estimate how widespread copying is in the animal kingdom and to postulate a timeline for the emergence of copying in our lineage.},

	abstract = {A mere few decades ago, culture was thought a unique human attribute. Evidence to the contrary accumulated through the latter part of the twentieth century and has exploded in the present one, demonstrating the transmission of traditions through social learning across all principal vertebrate taxa and even invertebrates, notably insects. The scope of human culture is nevertheless highly distinctive. What makes our cultural capacities and their cognitive underpinnings so different? In this article I argue that in behavioural scientists’ endeavours to answer this question, fruitful research pathways and their ensuing discoveries have come to exist alongside popular, yet in the light of current empirical evidence, highly questionable scenarios and even scientiﬁc blind alleys. I particularly re-evaluate theories that rely on the centrality of a supposed uniquely human capacity for imitative copying in explaining the distinctive capacity for massive cumulative cultural evolution (CCE) in our species. The most extreme versions of this perspective suffer logical incoherence and severe limits on scientiﬁc testability. By contrast the ﬁeld has generated a range of rigorous observational and experimental methodologies that have revealed both long-term cultural ﬁdelity and limited forms of CCE in non-human species. Attention now turns to directly investigating the scope, limits and underlying cognition of non-human versus human CCE, with a broader approach to factors additional to cultural transmission, notably the role of invention, innovation and evolved motivational biases underlying the scope of CCE in the species studied.},

However, starting a decade ago, this situation changed dramatically and Internet access became increasingly available in primate range countries. The rapid growth of smartphone use in developing nations has created new avenues to communicate conservation. Here we assess the potential of social media to promote primate conservation at the local level within primate range countries. We interviewed 381 people in communities associated with 18 conservation projects from 11 countries to assess their use of social media. We found that 91\% of the people had at least one social media account and 95\% of these people checked their accounts daily. The median number of contacts per person across all platforms was 453 and 300 considering only each person’s most used platform. We also documented that local conservation projects had a diversity of information they wanted to relay to the local community through social media. Our research highlights the potential for social media to be an extremely useful communication tool for tropical conservation scientists. Thus, we encourage more conservation groups to explore using social media to communicate to local communities and to report on the impact it has on conservation.},

	abstract = {Many of the world’s most biodiverse regions are found in the poorest and second most populous continent of Africa; a continent facing exceptional challenges. Africa is projected to quadruple its population by 2100 and experience increasingly severe climate change and environmental conflict—all of which will ravage biodiversity. Here we assess conservation threats facing Africa and consider how these threats will be affected by human population growth, economic expansion, and climate change. We then evaluate the current capacity and infrastructure available to conserve the continent’s biodiversity. We consider four key questions essential for the future of African conservation: (1) how to build societal support for conservation efforts within Africa; (2) how to build Africa’s education, research, and management capacity; (3) how to finance conservation efforts; and (4) is conservation through development the appropriate approach for Africa? While the challenges are great, ways forward are clear, and we present ideas on how progress can be made. Given Africa’s current modest capacity to address its biodiversity crisis, additional international funding is required, but estimates of the cost of conserving Africa’s biodiversity are within reach. The will to act must build on the sympathy for conservation that is evident in Africa, but this will require building the education capacity within the continent. Considering Africa’s rapidly growing population and the associated huge economic needs, options other than conservation through development need to be more effectively explored. Despite the gravity of the situation, we believe that concerted effort in the coming decades can successfully curb the loss of biodiversity in Africa.},

              Flies form high-density associations with human settlements and groups of nonhuman primates and are implicated in transmitting pathogens. We investigate the movement of nonhuman primate-associated flies across landscapes surrounding Kibale National Park, Uganda, using a mark–recapture experiment.

Flies marked in nonhuman primate groups were recaptured in human areas (19/28,615 recaptured). Metabarcoding of the flies in nonhuman primate groups revealed the DNA of multiple eukaryotic primate parasites. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential of flies to serve as vectors between nonhuman primates, livestock and humans at this biodiverse interface.},

This is partly because measuring reproduction in long-lived plants requires direct observation over many years and such datasets have rarely been made publicly available. Here we introduce MASTREE+, a data set that collates reproductive time-series data from across the globe and makes these data freely available to the community. MASTREE+ includes 73,828 georeferenced observations of annual reproduction (e.g. seed and fruit counts) in perennial plant populations worldwide. These observations consist of 5971 population-level time-series from 974 species in 66 countries. The mean and median time-series length is 12.4 and 10 years respectively, and the data set includes 1122 series that extend over at least two decades (≥20 years of observations). For a subset of well-studied species, MASTREE+ includes extensive replication of time-series across geographical and climatic gradients. Here we describe the open-access data set, available as a.csv file, and we introduce an associated web-based app for data exploration. MASTREE+ will provide the basis for improved understanding of the response of long-lived plant reproduction to environmental change. Additionally, MASTREE+ will enable investigation of the ecology and evolution of reproductive strategies in perennial plants, and the role of plant reproduction as a driver of ecosystem dynamics.},

Animal movement through forest canopies is constrained; unlike most aquatic or aerial habitats, the three-dimensional space of a forest canopy is not fully realized or available to the animals within it. Determining how the unique constraints of arboreal habitats shape the ecology and evolution of canopy-dwelling animals is key to fully understanding forest ecosystems. With emerging technologies, there is now the opportunity to quantify and map tree connectivity, and to embed the fine-scale horizontal and vertical position of moving animals into these networks of branching pathways. Integrating detailed multi-dimensional habitat structure and animal movement data will enable us to see the world from the perspective of an arboreal animal. This synthesis will shed light on fundamental aspects of arboreal animals’ cognition and ecology, including how they navigate landscapes of risk and reward and weigh energetic trade-offs, as well as how their environment shapes their spatial cognition and their social dynamics.},

Yet, data documenting long-­term trends are rare from the tropics, particularly the Afrotropics. Here we evaluate changes in the arthropod communities in Kibale National Park, Uganda across almost four decades. Systematic sweep-­net sampling was conducted in two forested sections of the park that had been logged and in one old-­growth forest area over 12 consecutive months in 1983/1984 and 2020/2021. This data was augmented with intermittent samples taken in 1986 and 1995. Arthropod abundance declined in all areas, but only significantly so in the moderately logged forestry compartment (41\%). Permutational multivariate analysis of variance indicated that community compositions of arthropods differed between the censuses. Understanding the drivers of changes in the arthropod communities is difficult as the system is complex and dynamic. We document an increase in temperature, but no change in rainfall, increases in 11 mammal species, including a marked increase in elephant numbers, and changes in forest structure. We also report on changes in the landscape outside of the park, which includes the human population increasing by a factor of four and agricultural intensification that now includes the use of pesticides. We document that many components of the ecosystem we studied changed simultaneously, which signals that for effective conservation planning, more long-­term multi-­disciplinary efforts are needed.},

This influential number, ‘Dunbar's number’, originates from an extrapolation of a regression line describing the relationship between relative neocortex size and group size in primates. Here, we test if there is statistical support for this idea. Our analyses on complementary datasets using different methods yield wildly different numbers. Bayesian and generalized least-squares phylogenetic methods generate approximations of average group sizes between 69–109 and 16–42, respectively. However, enormous 95\% confidence intervals (4–520 and 2–336, respectively) imply that specifying any one number is futile. A cognitive limit on human group size cannot be derived in this manner.},

This regression equation predicts a group size for modern humans very similar to that for hunter-gatherer and traditional horticulturalist societies. Similar group sizes are found in other contemporary and historical societies. Nonhuman primates maintain group cohesion through social grooming; among the Old World monkeys and apes, social grooming time is linearly related to group size. Maintaining stability of human-sized groups by grooming alone would make intolerable time demands. It is therefore suggested (1) that the evolution of large groups in the human lineage depended on developing a more efficient method for time-sharing the processes of social bonding and (2) that language uniquely fulfills this requirement. Data on the size of conversational and other small interacting groups of humans accord with the predicted relative efficiency of conversation compared to grooming as a bonding process. In human conversations about 60\% of time is spent gossiping about relationships and personal experiences. Language may accordingly have evolved to allow individuals to learn about the behavioural characteristics of other group members more rapidly than was feasible by direct observation alone.},

	abstract = {The ability to move allows animals to optimize their fitness by responding to spatial variability in their environment, such as changes in the location of food resources, predators, parasites, competitors, or reproductive partners. However, many animals remain within a limited area throughout their lives. Such site fidelity has been reported for social groups of nonhuman primates and other mammals over many years or even decades. The few studies that have addressed and confirmed long-term site fidelity in primates have focused on species feeding on presumably unevenly distributed food resources, such as fruit, which indicates heterogeneous habitat quality, a factor often considered to decrease site fidelity. However, if we want to test and extend theories about the ecological factors linked to site fidelity, including the role of habitat quality heterogeneity, studies about species feeding on more evenly distributed foods, such as leaves, are essential. Therefore, we here investigate the long-term ranging pattern of the leaf-eating (and endangered) red colobus (Piliocolobus tephrosceles) in Kibale National Park. For the period from 2010 until 2019, we established home range density estimates (HRDE) for our main study group for annual, 6-month, and 3-month periods via “autocorrelated kernel density estimation.” Then, we compared changes in these HRDEs across time using three metrics: (1) the “overlap” of HRDEs, which is a measure of similarity between (probability) distributions that reflect the estimated home ranges, (2) the distance between the centroids of the HRDEs, and (3) the distances between the points of maximum density of HRDEs. Our results indicate high home site fidelity for red colobus, as our study group was still using the same area after 10 years. Although these results are as expected, it is important to note that this pattern is similar in primates with other types of diet (including fruit). Thus, going forward, it will be crucial to quantitatively assess heterogeneity in food distribution for different types of diet and study additional factors that may lead to such a high site fidelity in many primates.},

However, we lack a predictive framework for the sensitivity of megabiota during times of rapid global change and how they impact the functioning of ecosystems and the biosphere. Here, we extend metabolic scaling theory and use global simulation models to demonstrate that (i) megabiota are more prone to extinction due to human land use, hunting, and climate change; (ii) loss of megabiota has a negative impact on ecosystem metabolism and functioning; and (iii) their reduction has and will continue to significantly decrease biosphere functioning. Global simulations show that continued loss of large animals alone could lead to a 44\%, 18\% and 92\% reduction in terrestrial heterotrophic biomass, metabolism, and fertility respectively. Our findings suggest that policies that emphasize the promotion of large trees and animals will have disproportionate impact on biodiversity, ecosystem processes, and climate mitigation.},

	abstract = {Vast areas of degraded tropical forest, combined with increasing interest in mitigating climate change and conserving biodiversity, demonstrate the potential value of restoring tropical forest. However, there is a lack of long-term studies assessing active management for restoration. Here we investigate Above-Ground Biomass (AGB), forest structure, and biodiversity, before degradation (in old-growth forest), after degradation (in abandoned agricultural savanna grassland), and within a forest that is actively being restored in Kibale National Park, Uganda. In 1995 degraded land in Kibale was protected from fire and replanted with native seedlings (39 species) at a density of 400seedlingsha−1. Sixty-five plots (50m×10m) were established in restoration areas in 2005 and 50 of these were re-measured in 2013, allowing changes to be assessed over 18years. Degraded plots have an Above Ground Biomass (AGB) of 5.1Mgdrymassha−1, of which 80\% is grass. By 2005 AGB of trees ⩾10cm DBH was 9.5Mgha−1, increasing to 40.6Mgha−1 by 2013, accumulating at a rate of 3.9Mgha−1year−1. A total of 153 planted individuals ha−1 (38\%) remained by 2013, contributing 28.9Mgha−1 (70\%) of total AGB. Eighteen years after restoration, AGB in the plots was 12\% of old-growth (419Mgha−1). If current accumulation rates continue restoration forest would reach old-growth AGB in a further 96years. Biodiversity of degraded plots prior to restoration was low with no tree species and 2 seedling species per sample plot (0.05ha). By 2005 restoration areas had an average of 3 tree and 3 seedling species per sample plot, increasing to 5 tree and 9 seedling species per plot in 2013. However, biodiversity was still significantly lower than old-growth forest, at 8 tree and 16 seedling species in an equivalent area. The results suggest that forest restoration is beneficial for AGB accumulation with planted stems storing the majority of AGB. Changes in biodiversity appear slower; possibly due to low stem turnover. Overall this restoration treatment is an effective means of restoring degraded land in the area, as can be seen from the lack of regeneration in degraded plots, which remain low-AGB and diversity, largely due to the impacts of fire and competition with grasses.},

	abstract = {The coexistence between humans and mammals across Africa has led to Human Wildlife Conflict (HWC) due to the competition for limited natural resources. Over the past two decades, I have focused my research on conservation issues that either resulted from or induce human-wildlife conflict. Conflicts are intensified in regions where dense human populations live in close proximity to nature, and where livestock holdings and crop fields form a significant part of rural livelihoods. As a result, both people and wildlife suffer tangible consequences; therefore, creating the need for stakeholder’s involvement and their willingness to adopt conservation-based behaviors, as key ingredients for feasible and effective conservation counter measures. This chapter provides a comprehensive review of the wide array of drivers and conservation implications of HWC incidences throughout Africa. An in-depth analysis is essential to understanding the problem and support future conservation prospects. Examples explore key case studies ranging from decreasing numbers of the charismatic forest dwelling elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) in the DRC, to increasing numbers of waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) in Mozambique, and varying numbers of lion populations bordering Kruger National Park in South Africa. Concluding with conflict resolution strategies employed across Africa and recommendations for the effective conservation of the world’s most endangered mammals.},

	abstract = {Animal social networks are often constructed from point estimates of edge weights. In many contexts, edge weights are inferred from observational data, and the uncertainty around estimates can be affected by various factors. Though this has been acknowledged in previous work, methods that explicitly quantify uncertainty in edge weights have not yet been widely adopted and remain undeveloped for many common types of data. Furthermore, existing methods are unable to cope with some of the complexities often found in observational data, and do not propagate uncertainty in edge weights to subsequent statistical analyses. We introduce a unified Bayesian framework for modelling social networks based on observational data. This framework, which we call BISoN, can accommodate many common types of observational social data, can capture confounds and model effects at the level of observations and is fully compatible with popular methods used in social network analysis. We show how the framework can be applied to common types of data and how various types of downstream statistical analyses can be performed, including non-random association tests and regressions on network properties. Our framework opens up the opportunity to test new types of hypotheses, make full use of observational datasets, and increase the reliability of scientific inferences. We have made both an R package and example R scripts available to enable adoption of the framework.},

In some cases, reciprocity may be expected to be more or less prevalent among certain kinds of dyads. In response to interest among researchers in estimating dyadic reciprocity as a function of covariates, this paper proposes an extension to the multilevel Social Relations Model. The outcome variable is assumed to be a binomial proportion, as is commonly encountered in observational and archival research. The approach draws on principles of multilevel modeling to implement random intercepts and slopes that vary among dyads. The corresponding variance function permits the computation of a dyadic reciprocity correlation. The modeling approach can potentially be integrated with other statistical models in the ﬁeld of social network analysis.},

	abstract = {Climate change is associated with more frequent extreme weather conditions and an overall increase in temperature around the globe. Its impact on individual ecosystems is not yet well known. Long-term data documenting climate and the temporal abundance of food for primates are scarce. We used long-term phenological data to assess climate variation, fruit abundance and home range sizes of the endemic and Critically Endangered crested macaques (Macaca nigra) in Tangkoko forest, Sulawesi, Indonesia. Between January 2012 and July 2020, every month, we monitored 498 individual trees from 41 species and 23 families. We noted each tree’s phenophase and assessed variation in climate (daily temperature and rainfall) and fruit abundance. We also investigated whether individual trees of known key food sources for macaques (New Guinea walnut trees, Dracontomelon spp, two species, N = 10 individual trees; fig trees, Ficus spp, four species, N = 34, and spiked peppers, Piper aduncum, N = 4) showed regular and synchronised fruiting cycles. We used 2877 days of ranging data from four habituated groups to estimate home ranges between January 2012 and July 2020. We created models to evaluate the impact of ecological factors (temperature, rainfall, overall fruit abundance, fig abundance). We found that the temperature increased in Tangkoko forest, and the overall fruit abundance decreased across the study. Top key fruits showed different trends in fruiting. Figs seem to be present year-round, but we did not detect synchrony between individuals of the same species. The macaque home ranges were about 2 k­ m2. Monthly temperature was the main predictor of home range size, especially in disturbed forest with previously burnt areas. This information will help to further monitor changes in the macaques’ habitat, and better understand ranging and foraging strategies of a Critically Endangered species and hence contribute to its conservation.},

We developed a hierarchical Bayesian approach to determine variation in the timing and quantity of fruit production. Our analysis accommodates missing censuses and quantiﬁes variation at seasonal and inter-annual scales. The fruiting peak of 22 of 45 species occurred during the peak of the rainy season, which is typical for central and eastern Amazon. The timing and quantity of fruit production varied substantially across years in most species, with greater variation in quantity than in timing. The timing of fruit production varied from continuously fruiting species to mast fruiting species that had two or more consecutive years without fruit production. Fully 40\% of species were mast fruiting species. The seasonal timing and inter-annual variation in fruiting were unrelated to seed dispersal mode across species. We saw no evidence for directional change in the level of fruit production, the timing of fruit production, or their variances; however, 10 yr is a short record for such analyses.},

These models cannot accommodate species that flower multiple times each year in humid tropical forests nor flowering data with census-interval rather than daily temporal resolution. Here, we present a new model framework able to predict the timing of multiple annual flowering events from census data. We extend a recent model, which predicted tropical flowering probabilities as discrete events occurring on census dates, by integrating predicted flowering probabilities over all dates between censuses. We evaluate our model against 29 years of daily climate and weekly flowering records for Hybanthus prunifolius (Violaceae) and Handroanthus guayacan (Bignoniaceae) from Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Previous experiments demonstrate that both species flower shortly after a heavy, dry-season rain interrupts an extended dry period. Our model captures this sequence of rainfall events. Best-fit model parameters are consistent with previous experimental results. This match suggests the new model framework will provide novel insights for other humid tropical forest species.},

Following the upgrading of the protection of Kibale from a forest reserve to a national park, wildlife populations generally increased. Bushpigs are an exception and their populations appear stable. The increases of ungulate and elephant pop­ ulations typically happened soon after park establishment, with the exception of the giant forest hog that only recently showed an increase. We conducted an assessment of Uganda Wildlife Authorities budget and those of the small NGOs working in the area and considered the contri­ bution that Makerere University Biological Field Stations makes to the community. This analysis indicates that with a small budget UWA and its collaborators have been successful in protecting the park’s ungulate and elephant populations. While the past decades have demonstrated the park’s ability to conserve biodiversity with limited resources, the changing climate and mounting pressures faced by the park will necessitate significantly increased investments.},

	abstract = {Many primate populations are threatened by human actions and a central tool used for their protection is establishing protected areas. However, even if populations in such areas are protected from hunting and deforestation, they still may be threatened by factors such as climate change and its cascading impacts on habitat quality and disease dynamics. Here we provide a long‐term and geographically widespread population assessment of the five common diurnal primates of Kibale National Park, Uganda. Over 7 year‐long or longer census efforts that spanned 52 years, our team walked 1466 km, and recorded 480 monkey groups. Populations were generally relatively stable with a few exceptions, for which no apparent causative factors could be identified. This stability is unexpected as many ecological changes documented over the last 34+ years (e.g., decreasing food abundance and quality) were predicted to have negative impacts. Populations of some species declined at some sites but increased at others. This highlights the need for large, protected areas so that declines in particular areas are countered by gains in others. Kibale has large areas of regenerating forest and this most recent survey revealed that after 20+ years, forest regeneration in many of these areas appears sufficient to sustain sizeable primate populations, except for blue monkeys that have not colonized these areas. Indeed, the average primate abundance in the regenerating forest was only 8.1\% lower than in neighboring old‐growth forest. Thus, park‐wide primate abundance has likely increased, despite many pressures on the park having risen; however, some areas in the park remain to be assessed. Our study suggests that the restoration, patrolling, and community outreach efforts of the Uganda Wildlife Authority and their partners have contributed significantly to protecting the park and its animals.},

Here, we adopt a comparative evolutionary perspective to test whether the evolution of social dominance hierarchies, a measure of social inequality in animals, exhibits phylogenetic conservatism and whether interspecific variation in these traits can be explained by sex, age or captivity. We find that hierarchy steepness and directional consistency evolve rapidly without any apparent constraint from evolutionary history. Given this extraordinary variability, we next consider multiple factors that have evolved to mitigate social inequality. Social networks, coalitionary support and knowledge transfer advantage to privilege some individuals over others. Nutritional access and prenatal stressors can impact the development of offspring, generating health disparities with intergenerational consequences. Intergenerational transfer of material resources (e.g. stone tools, food stashes, territories) advantage those who receive. Nonetheless, many of the same social species that experience unequal access to food (survival) and mates (reproduction) engage in levelling mechanisms such as food sharing, adoption, revolutionary coalitions, forgiveness and inequity aversion. Taken together, mammals rely upon a suite of mechanisms of (in)equality to balance the costs and benefits of group living.

	abstract = {The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) depends on sea ice for feeding, breeding, and movement. Signiﬁcant reductions in Arctic sea ice are forecast to continue because of climate warming. We evaluated the impacts of climate change on polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea by means of a demographic analysis, combining deterministic, stochastic, environmentdependent matrix population models with forecasts of future sea ice conditions from IPCC general circulation models (GCMs). The matrix population models classiﬁed individuals by age and breeding status; mothers and dependent cubs were treated as units. Parameter estimates were obtained from a capture–recapture study conducted from 2001 to 2006. Candidate statistical models allowed vital rates to vary with time and as functions of a sea ice covariate. Model averaging was used to produce the vital rate estimates, and a parametric bootstrap procedure was used to quantify model selection and parameter estimation uncertainty. Deterministic models projected population growth in years with more extensive ice coverage (2001–2003) and population decline in years with less ice coverage (2004–2005). LTRE (life table response experiment) analysis showed that the reduction in k in years with low sea ice was due primarily to reduced adult female survival, and secondarily to reduced breeding. A stochastic model with two environmental states, good and poor sea ice conditions, projected a declining stochastic growth rate, log ks, as the frequency of poor ice years increased. The observed frequency of poor ice years since 1979 would imply log ks ’ À 0.01, which agrees with available (albeit crude) observations of population size. The stochastic model was linked to a set of 10 GCMs compiled by the IPCC; the models were chosen for their ability to reproduce historical observations of sea ice and were forced with ‘‘business as usual’’ (A1B) greenhouse gas emissions. The resulting stochastic population projections showed drastic declines in the polar bear population by the end of the 21st century. These projections were instrumental in the decision to list the polar bear as a threatened species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.},

Central to this problem is the continued focus on hominid cognition as a benchmark and the assumption that behavioral complexity has a simple relationship with brain size. Although comparative studies of brain size have been criticized for not reflecting how evolution actually operates, and for producing spurious, inconsistent results, the causes of these limitations have received little discussion. We show how these issues arise from implicit assumptions about what brain size measures and how it correlates with behavioral and cognitive traits. We explore how inconsistencies can arise through heterogeneity in evolutionary trajectories and selection pressures on neuroanatomy or neurophysiology across taxa. We examine how interference from ecological and life history variables complicates interpretations of brain–behavior correlations and point out how this problem is exacerbated by the limitations of brain and cognitive measures. These considerations, and the diversity of brain morphologies and behavioral capacities, suggest that comparative brain–behavior research can make greater progress by focusing on specific neuroanatomical and behavioral traits within relevant ecological and evolutionary contexts. We suggest that a synergistic combination of the “bottom-up” approach of classical neuroethology and the “top-down” approach of comparative biology/psychology within closely related but behaviorally diverse clades can limit the effects of heterogeneity, interference, and noise. We argue that this shift away from broad-scale analyses of superficial phenotypes will provide deeper, more robust insights into brain evolution.},

A major source of this cultural variation is the variation in institutional complexity: the cultural packages of rules, norms, ontologies and expectations passed down through societies across generations. In this article, we study the emergence of institutions in small-scale societies. There are two primary schools of thought. The first is that institutions emerge top-down as rules are imposed by elites on their societies in order to gain asymmetrical access to power, resources and influence over others through coercion. The second is that institutions emerge bottom-up to facilitate interactions within populations as they seek collective solutions to adaptive problems. Here, we use Bayesian networks to infer the causal structure of institutional complexity in 172 small-scale societies across ethnohistoric western North America reflecting the wide diversity of indigenous lifestyles across this vast region immediately prior to European colonization. Our results suggest that institutional complexity emerges from underlying socioecological complexity because institutions are solutions to coordination problems in more complex environments where human–environment interactions require increased management.},

          Brain size varies greatly across and even within lineages. Attempts to explain this variation have mostly focused on the role of specific cognitive demands in the social or ecological domain. However, their predictive power is modest, whereas the effects of additional functions, especially sensory information processing and motor control, on brain size remain underexplored. Here, using phylogenetic comparative models, we show that the socio-cognitive and eco-cognitive demands do not have direct links to relative brain size (that is the residual from a regression against body mass) once morphological features are taken into account. Thus, specific cognitive abilities linked to social life or ecology play a much smaller role in brain size evolution than generally assumed. Instead, parental provisioning, generation length, and especially eye size and beak and leg morphology have a strong direct link to relative brain size. Phylogenetic lability analyses suggest that morphological diversification preceded changes in the rate of brain size evolution and greater visual input, and thus that morphological diversification opened up specialized niches where efficient foraging could produce energy surpluses. Increases in brain size provided general behavioural flexibility, which improved survival by reducing interspecific competition and predation, and was made possible by intense parental provisioning. Indeed, comparative analyses in a subset of species show that thicker beaks are associated with larger size of brain regions involved in behavioural flexibility (telencephalon, pallium). Thus, morphological evolution had a key role in niche diversification, which subsequently may have facilitated the evolution of general cognitive flexibility.},

	abstract = {Scientists have long struggled to establish how larger brains translate into higher cognitive performance across species. While absolute brain size often yields high predictive power of performance, its positive correlation with body size warrants some level of correction. It is expected that larger brains are needed to control larger bodies without any changes in cognitive performance. Potentially, the mean value of intraspecific brain-body slopes provides the best available estimate for an interspecific correction factor. For example, in primates, including humans, an increase in body size translates into an increase in brain size without changes in cognitive performance. Here, we provide the first evaluation of this hypothesis for another clade, teleost fishes. First, we obtained a mean intraspecific brain-body regression slope of 0.46 (albeit with a relatively large range of 0.26–0.79) from a dataset of 51 species, with at least 10 wild adult specimens per species. This mean intraspecific slope value (0.46) is similar to that of the encephalisation quotient reported for teleosts (0.5), which can be used to predict mean cognitive performance in fishes. Importantly, such a mean value (0.46) is much higher than in endothermic vertebrate species (≤0.3). Second, we used wild-caught adult cleaner fish \textit{Labroides dimidiatus} as a case study to test whether variation in individual cognitive performance can be explained by body size. We first obtained the brain-body regression slope for this species from two different datasets, which gave slope values of 0.58 (MRI scan data) and 0.47 (dissection data). Then, we used another dataset involving 69 adult cleaners different from those tested for their brain-body slope. We found that cognitive performance from four different tasks that estimated their learning, numerical, and inhibitory control abilities was not significantly associated with body size. These results suggest that the intraspecific brain-body slope captures cognitive equivalence for this species. That is, individuals that are on the brain-body regression line are cognitively equal. While rather preliminary, our results suggest that fish and mammalian brain organisations are fundamentally different, resulting in different intra- and interspecific slopes of cognitive equivalence.},

	abstract = {Large brains support numerous cognitive adaptations and therefore may appear to be highly beneficial. Nonetheless, the high energetic costs of brain tissue may have prevented the evolution of large brains in many species. This problem may also have a developmental dimension: juveniles, with their immature and therefore poorly performing brains, would face a major energetic hurdle if they were to pay for the construction of their own brain, especially in larger-brained species. Here, we explore the possible role of parental provisioning for the development and evolution of adult brain size in birds. A comparative analysis of 1,176 bird species shows that various measures of parental provisioning (precocial vs. altricial state at hatching, relative egg mass, time spent provisioning the young) strongly predict relative brain size across species. The parental provisioning hypothesis also provides an explanation for the well-documented but so far unexplained pattern that altricial birds have larger brains than precocial ones. We therefore conclude that the evolution of parental provisioning allowed species to overcome the seemingly insurmountable energetic constraint on growing large brains, which in turn enabled bird species to increase survival and population stability. Because including adult eco- and socio-cognitive predictors only marginally improved the explanatory value of our models, these findings also suggest that the traditionally assessed cognitive abilities largely support successful parental provisioning. Our results therefore indicate that the cognitive adaptations underlying successful parental provisioning also provide the behavioral flexibility facilitating reproductive success and survival.},

	abstract = {Both absolute and relative brain sizes vary greatly among and within the major vertebrate lineages. Scientists have long debated how larger brains in primates and hominins translate into greater cognitive performance, and in particular how to control for the relationship between the noncognitive functions of the brain and body size. One solution to this problem is to establish the slope of cognitive equivalence, i.e., the line connecting organisms with an identical bauplan but different body sizes. The original approach to estimate this slope through intraspecific regressions was abandoned after it became clear that it generated slopes that were too low by an unknown margin due to estimation error. Here, we revisit this method. We control for the error problem by focusing on highly dimorphic primate species with large sample sizes and fitting a line through the mean values for adult females and males. We obtain the best estimate for the slope of circa 0.27, a value much lower than those constructed using all mammal species and close to the value expected based on the genetic correlation between brain size and body size. We also find that the estimate of cognitive brain size based on cognitive equivalence fits empirical cognitive studies better than the encephalization quotient, which should therefore be avoided in future studies on primates and presumably mammals and birds in general. The use of residuals from the line of cognitive equivalence may change conclusions concerning the cognitive abilities of extant and extinct primate species, including hominins.},

	abstract = {Across the animal kingdom, we see remarkable variation in brain size. This variation has even increased over evolutionary time. Traditionally, studies aiming to explain brain size evolution have looked at the ﬁtness beneﬁts of increased brain size in relation to its increased cognitive performance in the social and/or ecological domain. However, brains are among the most energetically expensive tissues in the body and also require an uninterrupted energy supply. If not compensated, these energetic demands inevitably lead to a reduction in energy allocation to other vital functions. In this review, we summarize how an increasing number of studies show that to fully comprehend brain size evolution and the large variation in brain size across lineages, it is important to look at the economics of brains, including the different pathways through which the high energetic costs of brains can be offset. We further show how numerous studies converge on the conclusion that cognitive abilities can only drive brain size evolution in vertebrate lineages where they result in an improved energy balance through favourable ecological preconditions. Cognitive beneﬁts that do not directly improve the organism’s energy balance can only be selectively favoured when they produce such large improvements in reproduction or survival that they outweigh the negative energetic effects of the large brain.},

Here, we test this prediction for the extreme case of hibernation. Hibernators drastically reduce food intake for up to several months and are therefore expected to have smaller relative brain sizes than nonhibernating species. Using a comparative phylogenetic approach on brain size estimates of 1104 mammalian species, and controlling for possible confounding variables, we indeed found that the presence of hibernation in mammals is correlated with decreased relative brain size. This result adds to recent comparative work across mammals and amphibians supporting the idea that environmental seasonality (where in extremis hibernation is necessary for survival) imposes an energetic challenge and thus acts as an evolutionary constraint on relative brain size.},

	abstract = {Primates, like other mammals, exhibit an annual reproductive pattern that ranges from strictly seasonal breeding to giving birth in all months of the year, but factors mediating this variation are not fully understood. We applied both a categorical description and quantitative measures of the birth peak breadth based on daily observations in zoos to characterise reproductive seasonality in 141 primate species with an average of 941 birth events per species. Absolute day length at the beginning of the mating season in seasonally reproducing species was not correlated between populations from natural habitats and zoos. The mid-point of latitudinal range was a major factor associated with reproductive seasonality, indicating a correlation with photoperiod. Gestation length, annual mean temperature, natural diet and Malagasy origin were other important factors associated with reproductive seasonality. Birth seasons were shorter with increasing latitude of geographical origin, corresponding to the decreasing length of the favourable season. Species with longer gestation periods were less seasonal than species with shorter ones, possibly because shorter gestation periods more easily facilitate the synchronisation of reproductive activity with annual cycles. Habitat conditions with higher mean annual temperature were also linked to less-seasonal reproduction, independently of the latitude effect. Species with a high percentage of leaves in their natural diet were generally non-seasonal, potentially because the availability of mature leaves is comparatively independent of seasons. Malagasy primates were more seasonal in their births than species from other regions. This might be due to the low resting metabolism of Malagasy primates, the comparatively high degree of temporal predictability of Malagasy ecosystems, or historical constraints peculiar to Malagasy primates. Latitudinal range showed a weaker but also signiﬁcant association with reproductive seasonality. Amongst species with seasonal reproduction in their natural habitats, smaller primate species were more likely than larger species to shift to non-seasonal breeding in captivity. The percentage of species that changed their breeding pattern in zoos was higher in primates (30\%) than in previous studies on Carnivora and Ruminantia (13 and 10\%, respectively), reﬂecting a higher concentration of primate species in the tropics. When comparing only species that showed seasonal reproduction in natural habitats at absolute latitudes ≤11.75 , primates did not differ signiﬁcantly from these two other taxa in the proportion of species that changed to a less-seasonal pattern in zoos. However, in this latitude range, natural populations of primates and Carnivora had a signiﬁcantly higher proportion of seasonally reproducing species than Ruminantia, suggesting that in spite of their generally more ﬂexible diets, both primates and Carnivora are more exposed to resource ﬂuctuation than ruminants.},

	abstract = {If social learning is more efficient than independent individual exploration, animals should learn vital cultural skills exclusively, and routine skills faster, through social learning, provided they actually use social learning preferentially. Animals with opportunities for social learning indeed do so. Moreover, more frequent opportunities for social learning should boost an individual's repertoire of learned skills. This prediction is confirmed by comparisons among wild great ape populations and by social deprivation and enculturation experiments. These findings shaped the cultural intelligence hypothesis, which complements the traditional benefit hypotheses for the evolution of intelligence by specifying the conditions in which these benefits can be reaped. The evolutionary version of the hypothesis argues that species with frequent opportunities for social learning should more readily respond to selection for a greater number of learned skills. Because improved social learning also improves asocial learning, the hypothesis predicts a positive interspecific correlation between social-learning performance and individual learning ability. Variation among primates supports this prediction. The hypothesis also predicts that more heavily cultural species should be more intelligent. Preliminary tests involving birds and mammals support this prediction too. The cultural intelligence hypothesis can also account for the unusual cognitive abilities of humans, as well as our unique mechanisms of skill transfer.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          Over the past few decades studies have provided strong evidence that the robust links between the social environment, health, and survival found in humans also extend to non-human social animals. A number of these studies emphasize the early life origins of these effects. For example, in several social mammals, more socially engaged mothers have infants with higher rates of survival compared to less socially engaged mothers, suggesting that positive maternal social relationships causally improve offspring survival. Here we show that the relationship between infant survival and maternal sociality is confounded by previously underappreciated variation in female social behavior linked to changes in reproductive state and the presence of a live infant. Using data from a population of wild baboons living in the Amboseli basin of Kenya – a population where high levels of maternal sociality have previously been linked to improved infant survival – we find that infant- and reproductive state-dependent changes in female social behavior drive a statistically significant relationship between maternal sociality and infant survival. After accounting for these state-dependent changes in social behavior, maternal sociality is no longer positively associated with infant survival in this population. Our results emphasize the importance of considering multiple explanatory pathways—including third-variable effects—when studying the social determinants of health in natural populations.},

	abstract = {This chapter applies an integrated approach to decision-making and cultural evolution to explore some of the characteristics that influence population-level differences in innovativeness and to understand how such differences emerge. In laying the foundation for subsequent arguments I begin by summarizing research showing how evolutionary theory can direct and inform our understanding of decision-making, social learning and cultural evolution. Then, extending insights from existing cultural evolutionary models, I examine how a population's size and degree of 'cultural interconnectedness' can influence rates of both innovation and invention. A simple model illustrates the relative importance of cultural interconnectedness compared to individual invention. Combining ethno-historical and archaeological cases, I further explore the relative importance of "mother necessity" and "heroic genius" vs. recombination, lucky mistakes, and the accretion of small changes in driving invention. This discussion suggests that, at best, "necessity" is neither necessary nor sufficient to explain invention and that invention processes are dominated by incremental additions, recombinations, and lucky errors, not revolutionary insights. This means that inventiveness is—at least in part—a product of large populations (that generate more lucky errors) and greater interconnectedness that together with population size favors more recombinant inventions, as well as a greater likelihood of these diffusing widely. Lastly, I examine how increasing the interconnectedness in a population gives rise to an n-person cooperative dilemma. While some partial solutions to this dilemma have emerged across our species, only some societies have evolved the informal (and later formal) institutions—i.e., systems of reputation, signaling, and punishment—that favor the wide sharing of information, ideas and insights. Theoretical work has revealed three avenues to solving such n-person cooperative dilemmas, but crucially, all three generate multiple stable equilibria, meaning that while they can stabilize cooperative information sharing, they can also stabilize "information hiding and free-riding" as well as other non-group-beneficial states. In such circumstances, processes of cultural group selection, which operate through various forms of competition among groups, can favor the evolution of those institutional forms that best promote the open dissemination so crucial to innovation. This line of thinking proposes that cultural evolution has favored the emergence of institutions that increase cultural interconnectedness, thereby stimulating both greater inventiveness and more innovation at the population level.},

	abstract = {A major goal of behavioural ecology is to explain how phenotypic and ecological factors shape the networks of social relationships that animals form with one another. This inferential task is notoriously challenging. The social networks of interest are generally not observed, but must be approximated from behavioural samples. Moreover, these data are highly dependent: the observed network edges correlate with one another, due to biological and sampling processes. Failing to account for the resulting uncertainty and biases can lead to dysfunctional statistical procedures, and thus to incorrect results. Here, we argue that these problems should be understood—and addressed—as problems of causal inference. For this purpose, we introduce a Bayesian causal modelling framework that explicitly defines the links between the target interaction network, its causes, and the data. We illustrate the mechanics of our framework with simulation studies and an empirical example. First, we encode causal effects of individual-, dyad-, and group-level features on social interactions using Directed Acyclic Graphs and Structural Causal Models. These quantities are the objects of inquiry, our estimands. Second, we develop estimators for these effects—namely, Bayesian multilevel extensions of the Social Relations Model. Third, we recover the structural parameters of interest, map statistical estimates to the underlying causal structures, and compute causal estimates from the joint posterior distribution. Throughout the manuscript, we develop models layer by layer, thereby illustrating an iterative workflow for causal inference in social networks. We conclude by summarising this workflow as a set of seven steps, and provide practical recommendations.},

	abstract = {Efficient foraging plays a critical role in fitness, yet food choices and underlying nutritional goals vary among animals. To understand those choices and therefore the importance of different food resources, many studies estimate food preferences by applying electivity indices that account for resource availabilities. However, the general applicability of electivity indices in biologically relevant foraging scenarios is unclear. Our major aims were to find effective methods to estimate animals' food choices and to investigate long-term food choices and underlying nutritional goals of the red colobus monkey (Piliocolobus tephrosceles) in Kibale National Park, Uganda, an endangered folivore. We used simulations of different foraging conditions to evaluate the applicability of electivity indices in biologically relevant scenarios to help interpret our results. Then, we used long-term data collected between 2006 and 2016 on the feeding behavior and ecology of red colobus to determine the consumption frequencies of different foods and their food preferences. Based on these results and nutritional concentrations of young leaves of frequently consumed tree species, we investigated the importance of the protein-to-fiber ratio in their diet. Our simulations highlight limitations of electivity indices in biologically relevant foraging scenarios. Further, red colobus clearly chose young leaves over other plant parts, and, considering species and plant part, red colobus fed on many different items, but few dominated their diet. The availability and spatial distribution varied across the most consumed foods, but red colobus preferences remained mostly stable over time. Protein-to-fiber ratio had no association with preference but with consumption frequencies of different young leaves. The limitations of electivity indices in different foraging conditions underline the importance of comparing food preferences with consumption frequencies to assess the importance of different food resources. Our results provide a robust understanding of the food choices and nutritional goals of a leaf-eating animal that can ultimately be used for implementing more effective conservation measures by directing habitat protection or restoration efforts toward these resources.},

For animals reliant on leaves as a primary food source, understanding how climate change influences leaf production of trees is crucial, yet this is understudied, especially in moist evergreen tropical forests. We analyzed a 23-year dataset of young leaf phenology from a moist tropical forest in Kibale National Park, Uganda, to examine seasonal and long-term patterns of 12 key tree species consumed by folivorous primates. We described phenological patterns and explored relationships between young leaf production of different tree species and climate variables. We also assessed the suitability of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) as a proxy for young leaf production in moist evergreen tropical forests. Our results showed that tree species exhibited distinct phenological patterns, with most species producing young leaves during two seasonal peaks aligned with the rainy seasons. Rainfall, cloud cover, and maximum temperature were the most informative predictors of seasonal variation in young leaf production. However, solar radiation and atmospheric CO\$\_2\$ were most informative regarding long-term trends. EVI was strongly correlated with young leaf production within years but less effective for capturing inter-annual trends. These findings highlight the complex relationship between climate and young leaf phenology in moist evergreen tropical forests, and helps us understand the changes in food availability for tropical folivores.},

To examine the seasonal pattern of phytoestrogen consumption and its relationship to hormone levels (407 fecal samples analyzed for estradiol and cortisol) and social behavior (aggression, mating, and grooming) in a primate, we conducted an 11-month ﬁeld study of red colobus (Procolobus rufomitratus) in Kibale National Park, Uganda. The percent of diet from estrogenic plants averaged 10.7\% (n=45 weeks; range: 0.7–32.4\%). Red colobus fed more heavily on estrogenic Millettia dura young leaves during weeks of higher rainfall, and the consumption of this estrogenic item was positively correlated to both their fecal estradiol and cortisol levels. Social behaviors were related to estradiol and cortisol levels, as well as the consumption of estrogenic plants and rainfall. The more the red colobus consumed estrogenic plants the higher their rates of aggression and copulation and the lower their time spent grooming. Our results suggest that the consumption of estrogenic plants has important implications for primate health and ﬁtness through interactions with the endocrine system and changes in hormone levels and social behaviors.},

	abstract = {Climate change is expected to cause irreversible changes to biodiversity, but predicting those risks remains uncertain. I synthesized 485 studies and more than 5 million projections to produce a quantitative global assessment of climate change extinctions. With increased certainty, this meta-analysis suggests that extinctions will accelerate rapidly if global temperatures exceed 1.5°C. The highest-emission scenario would threaten approximately one-third of species, globally. Amphibians; species from mountain, island, and freshwater ecosystems; and species inhabiting South America, Australia, and New Zealand face the greatest threats. In line with predictions, climate change has contributed to an increasing proportion of observed global extinctions since 1970. Besides limiting greenhouse gases, pinpointing which species to protect first will be critical for preserving biodiversity until anthropogenic climate change is halted and reversed.

            Editor’s summary
            Because it is clear that human activities are altering the global climate, researchers have been studying potential effects and predicting declines and extinctions. Understanding the consequences globally requires the synthesis of many studies. Following up on an initial effort nearly 10 years ago, Urban found that we can expect, with increased certainty, that rising temperatures will lead to an increasing number of extinctions, with the highest emission scenario leading to extinction of nearly a third of the Earth’s species, especially those from particular vulnerable taxa or regions. —Sacha Vignieri},

	abstract = {Central African evergreen broadleaved forests around the equator exhibit a double annual cycle for canopy phenology and carbon uptake seasonality. The underlying drivers of this behavior are poorly understood and the double seasonality is not captured by land surface models (LSM). In this study, we developed a new leaf phenology module into the ORCHIDEE LSM (hereafter ORCHIDEE‐AFP), which utilizes short‐wave incoming radiation (SWd) as the main driver of leaf shedding and partial rejuvenation of the canopy, to simulate the double seasonality of central African forests. The ORCHIDEE‐AFP model has been evaluated by using field data from two forest sites and satellite observations of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), which is a proxy of young leaf area index (LAIYoung) with leafage less than 6 months, as well as six products of GPP or GPP proxies. Results demonstrate that ORCHIDEE‐AFP successfully reproduces observed leaf turnover (R = 0.45) and young leaf abundance (R = 0.74), and greatly improve the representation of the bimodal leaf phenology. The proportion of grid cells with a significant positive correlation between the seasonality of modeled LAIYoung and observed EVI increased from 0.2\% in the standard model to 27\% in the new model. For photosynthesis, the proportions of grid cells with significant positive correlations between modeled and observed seasonality range from 26\% to 65\% across the six GPP evaluation products. The improved performance of the ORCHIDEE‐AFP model in simulating leaf phenology and photosynthesis of central African forests will allow a more accurate assessment of the impacts of climate change in tropical forests.},

The estimated magnitude of the historic CO2 fertilization, however, differs by an order of magnitude between long-term proxies, remote sensing-based estimates and terrestrial biosphere models. Here we constrain the likely historic effect of CO2 on global photosynthesis by combining terrestrial biosphere models, ecological optimality theory, remote sensing approaches and an emergent constraint based on global carbon budget estimates. Our analysis suggests that CO2 fertilization increased global annual terrestrial photosynthesis by 13.5 ± 3.5\% or 15.9 ± 2.9 PgC (mean ± s.d.) between 1981 and 2020. Our results help resolve conflicting estimates of the historic sensitivity of global terrestrial photosynthesis to CO2 and highlight the large impact anthropogenic emissions have had on ecosystems worldwide.},

However, how GPP dynamics respond to vegetation structural change (VSC), climate change, and rising CO2 concentration are still unclear. In this study, we developed a process-based model (i.e., Farquhar GPP Model) to characterize GPP dynamics in China from 2001 to 2016, and further identify the dominant drivers for GPP variation related to VSC, climate change, and rising atmospheric CO2 through model scenario design. During the study period, VSC showed an overwhelmingly positive impact on annual total GPP (i.e., 39.2 Tg C yr−1, P{\textless}0.001), followed by the fertilization effect of rising CO2 (i.e., 11.9 Tg C yr−1, P{\textless}0.001). However, climate variation would be expected to have an overall negative effect (i.e., -9.9 Tg C yr−1, P{\textless}0.001), which is primarily related to the decline of the incoming solar radiation over this period. Consequently, China's GPP showed a remarkable upward trend (i.e., 40.5 Tg C yr−1, P{\textless}0.001) during the study period. Our study highlighted the strong positive GPP contribution from VSC, which is mainly related to forest increase under the background of forest cover changes primarily from widespread forest conservation and restoration programs implemented in China since the late 1990s. Therefore, our study suggests that forest conservation and restoration could effectively increase terrestrial ecosystem GPP, despite the negative effects of climate change.},

A high degree of fission–fusion dynamics may constrain the regulation of social relationships, introducing uncertainty in interactions between group members. Here we use Shannon's entropy to quantify the predictability of subgroup composition for three species known to differ in the way their subgroups come together and split over time: spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi), chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and geladas (Theropithecus gelada). We formulate a random expectation of entropy that considers subgroup size variation and sample size, against which the observed entropy in subgroup composition can be compared. Using the theory of set partitioning, we also develop a method to estimate the number of subgroups that the group is likely to be divided into, based on the composition and size of single focal subgroups. Our results indicate that Shannon's entropy and the estimated number of subgroups present at a given time provide quantitative metrics of uncertainty in the social environment (within which social relationships must be regulated) for groups with different degrees of fission–fusion dynamics. These metrics also represent an indirect quantification of the cognitive challenges posed by socially dynamic environments. Overall, our novel methodological approach provides new insight for understanding the evolution of social complexity and the mechanisms to cope with the uncertainty that results from fission–fusion dynamics.},

Here, I review a body of work on the developmental dynamics of pigtailed macaque social organization and conflict management that provides insight into the mechanistic causes of multi-scale social systems. In this model system coarse-grained, statistical representations of collective dynamics are more predictive of the future state of the system than the constantly in-flux behavioural patterns at the individual level. The data suggest that individuals can perceive and use these representations for strategical decision-making. As an interaction history accumulates the coarse-grained representations consolidate. This constrains individual behaviour and provides the foundations for new levels of organization. The time-scales on which these representations change impact whether the consolidating higher-levels can be modified by individuals and collectively. The time-scales appear to be a function of the ‘coarseness’ of the representations and the character of the collective dynamics over which they are averages. The data suggest that an advantage of multiple timescales is that they allow social systems to balance tradeoffs between predictability and adaptability. I briefly discuss the implications of these findings for cognition, social niche construction and the evolution of new levels of organization in biological systems.},

We consider the properties that complexity measures would need to have to best capture regularities at different level of analysis, from individual rules to circuits to population statistics. One obvious benefit of using the properties and structure of biological and social systems to guide the development of complexity measures is that it is more likely to produce measures that can be applied to data. Principled but pragmatic measures would allow for a rigorous investigation of the relationship between adaptive features at the micro, meso, and macro scales, a long standing goal of evolutionary theory. A second benefit is that empirically grounded complexity measures would facilitate quantitative comparisons of strategies, circuits, and aggregate properties across social systems.},

However, despite substantial progress, events that are unprecedented in the local observational record remain a persistent challenge. Leveraging observations and a large climate model ensemble, we quantify uncertainty in the influence of global warming on the severity and probability of the historically hottest month, hottest day, driest year, and wettest 5-d period for different areas of the globe. We find that historical warming has increased the severity and probability of the hottest month and hottest day of the year at {\textgreater}80\% of the available observational area. Our framework also suggests that the historical climate forcing has increased the probability of the driest year and wettest 5-d period at 57\% and 41\% of the observed area, respectively, although we note important caveats. For the most protracted hot and dry events, the strongest and most widespread contributions of anthropogenic climate forcing occur in the tropics, including increases in probability of at least a factor of 4 for the hottest month and at least a factor of 2 for the driest year. We also demonstrate the ability of our framework to systematically evaluate the role of dynamic and thermodynamic factors such as atmospheric circulation patterns and atmospheric water vapor, and find extremely high statistical confidence that anthropogenic forcing increased the probability of record-low Arctic sea ice extent.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests are renowned for their astonishing diversity of life, but the fundamental question of how many species occur in tropical forests remains unanswered. Using geographic range maps and data on species habitat associations, we determined that tropical forests harbor 62\% of global terrestrial vertebrate species, more than twice the number found in any other terrestrial biome on Earth. Up to 29\% of global vertebrate species are endemic to tropical forests, with more than 20\% of these species at risk of extinction. Humid tropical forests (also known as tropical rainforests) and the Neotropics dominate as centers of species diversity, harboring more than 90\% and nearly half of all tropical forest vertebrates, respectively. To maintain the biodiversity that underpins the ecosystem functions and services essential for human well-being, we emphasize the critical importance of environmental policies aimed at reducing tropical deforestation and mitigating deleterious anthropogenic pressures on these imperiled ecosystems.},

However, the recruit assemblage shows shifts of 21\% relative to climate change expectation.

	abstract = {Fruit type has a major impact on seed dispersal, seed predation and energy allocation, but our understanding of large-scale patterns in fruit type variation is weak. We used a dataset of 4008 Australian species to provide the first continental-scale tests of a series of hypotheses about the factors that might affect fruit type. We found a significant latitudinal gradient in the proportion of fleshy-fruited species, with the percentage of fleshy-fruited species rising from 19\% at 43.75°S to 49\% at 9.25°S. Species bearing fleshy fruits were more frequent on the coastal fringes of Australia, while species bearing non-fleshy fruits became more frequent toward the arid centre. Wet, warm and stable climates favoured fleshy-fruited species, with the two best predictors of the proportion of fleshy-fruited species being maximum precipitation over five days (R2 = 0.40), and precipitation in the wettest month (R2 = 0.25). These results remained consistent after accounting for phylogenetic correlation among species. A combined model including variables of precipitation, temperature, and climatic variation explained 67\% of the variation in the proportion of fleshy-fruited species. Our results are consistent with the idea that plant reproductive strategies are more often tied to conditions during the parts of the year in which they grow than to conditions during the harsh parts of the year. Overall, our findings demonstrate strong relationships between plant reproductive traits and environmental gradients, and improve our understanding of the factors that shape large-scale patterns in plant ecological strategies.},

Ten species (3\%) flowered significantly later in the 1990s than previously. These data reveal the strongest biological signal yet of climatic change. Flowering is especially sensitive to the temperature in the previous month, and spring-flowering species are most responsive. However, large interspecific differences in this response will affect both the structure of plant communities and gene flow between species as climate warms. Annuals are more likely to flower early than congeneric perennials, and insect-pollinated species more than wind-pollinated ones.},

This study examined an extensive set of biological records to investigate changes in the timing of life history transitions (specifically emergence) in British Odonata between 1960 and 2004. The results show that there has been a significant, consistent advance in phenology in the taxon as a whole over the period of warming that is mediated by life history traits. British odonates significantly advanced the leading edge (first quartile date) of the flight period by a mean of 1.51 ±0.060 (SEM, n=17) days per decade or 3.08±1.16 (SEM, n=17) days per degree rise in temperature when phylogeny is controlled for. This study represents the first review of changes in odonate phenology in relation to climate change. The results suggest that the damped temperature oscillations experienced by aquatic organisms compared with terrestrial organisms are sufficient to evoke phenological responses similar to those of purely terrestrial taxa.},

We synthesize some of our existing understanding of autumn phenology and identify five areas ripe for future climate change research.

Here, I review recent findings in three areas—shifts in phenology, changes in voltinism, and altered species interactions—and highlight counterintuitive responses to warming caused by the particularities of insect life cycles.

	abstract = {To understand how researchers are tackling globally important issues, it is crucial to identify whether current research is comprehensive enough to make substantive predictions about general responses. We examined how research on climate change affecting insects is being assessed, what factors are being tested and the localities of studies, from 1703 papers published between 1985 and August 2012. Most published research (64\%) is generated from Europe and North America and being dedicated to core data analysis, with 29\% of the studies analysed dedicated to Lepidoptera and 22\% Diptera: which are well above their contribution to the currently identified insect species richness (estimated at 13\% and 17\% respectively). Research publications on Coleoptera fall well short of their proportional contribution (19\% of publications but 39\% of insect species identified), and to a lesser extent so do Hemiptera, and Hymenoptera. Species specific responses to changes in temperature by assessing distribution/range shifts or changes in abundance were the most commonly used methods of assessing the impact of climate change on insects. Research on insects and climate change to date is dominated by manuscripts assessing butterflies in Europe, insects of economic and/or environmental concern in forestry, agriculture, and model organisms. The research on understanding how insects will respond to a rapidly changing climate is still in its infancy, but the current trends of publications give a good basis for how we are attempting to assess insect responses. In particular, there is a crucial need for broader studies of ecological, behavioural, physiological and life history responses to be addressed across a greater range of geographic locations, particularly Asia, Africa and Australasia, and in areas of high human population growth and habitat modification. It is still too early in our understanding of taxa responses to climate change to know if charismatic taxa, such as butterflies, or disease vectors, including Diptera, can be used as keystone taxa to generalise other insect responses to climate change. This is critical as the basic biology of most species is still poorly known, and dominant, well studied taxa may show variable responses to climate change across their distribution due to regional biotic and abiotic influences. Indeed identifying if insect responses to climate change can be generalised using phylogeny, functional traits, or functional groups, or will populations and species exhibit idiosyncratic responses, should be a key priority for future research.},

Here we show that winter recovery distances have decreased over the past seven decades, for birds ringed during the breeding season in the Netherlands between 1932 and 2004. Of the 24 species included in the analysis, we found in 12 a significant decrease of the distance to the wintering site. Species from dry, open areas shortened their distance the most, species from wet, open areas the least, while woodland species fall in between the other two habitats. The decline in migration distance is likely due to climate change, as migration distances are negatively correlated with the Dutch temperatures in the winter of recovery. With a shorter migration distance, species should be better able to predict the onset of spring at their breeding sites and this could explain the stronger advancement of arrival date found in several short distance species relative to long-distance migrants.},

	abstract = {As a response to increasing spring temperature in temperate regions in recent years, populations of many plant and animal species, including migratory birds, have advanced the seasonal start of their reproduction or growth. However, the effects of climate changes on subsequent events of the annual cycle remain poorly understood. We investigated long–term changes in the timing of autumn migration in birds, a key event in the annual cycle limiting the reproductive period. Using data spanning a 42–year period, we analysed long–term changes in the passage of 65 species of migratory birds through Western Europe. The autumn passage of migrants wintering south of the Sahara has advanced in recent years, presumably as a result of selection pressure to cross the Sahel before its seasonal dry period. In contrast, migrants wintering north of the Sahara have delayed autumn passage. In addition, species with a variable rather than a fixed number of broods per year have delayed passage, possibly because they are free to attempt more broods. Recent climate changes seem to have a simple unidirectional effect on the seasonal onset of reproduction, but complex and opposing effects on the timing of subsequent events in the annual cycle, depending on the ecology and life history of a species. This complicates predictions of overall effects of global warming on avian communities.},

New work on a migratory bird, the pied flycatcher, takes things a stage further by showing how a climate-related population decline was actually caused. Timing is key. Over the past 17 years flycatchers declined strongly in areas where caterpillar numbers (food for the nestlings) peak early, but in areas with a late food peak there was no decline. The young birds arrive too late where caterpillars have responded to early warmth. Mistiming like this is probably a common consequence of climate change, and may be a major factor in the decline of many long-distance migratory bird species.},

	abstract = {Global climate change impacts can already be tracked in many physical and biological systems; in particular, terrestrial ecosystems provide a consistent picture of observed changes. One of the preferred indicators is phenology, the science of natural recurring events, as their recorded dates provide a high-temporal resolution of ongoing changes. Thus, numerous analyses have demonstrated an earlier onset of spring events for mid and higher latitudes and a lengthening of the growing season. However, published single-site or single-species studies are particularly open to suspicion of being biased towards predominantly reporting climate change-induced impacts. No comprehensive study or meta-analysis has so far examined the possible lack of evidence for changes or shifts at sites where no temperature change is observed. We used an enormous systematic phenological network data set of more than 125 000 observational series of 542 plant and 19 animal species in 21 European countries (1971–2000). Our results showed that 78\% of all leafing, flowering and fruiting records advanced (30\% significantly) and only 3\% were significantly delayed, whereas the signal of leaf colouring/fall is ambiguous. We conclude that previously published results of phenological changes were not biased by reporting or publication predisposition: the average advance of spring/summer was 2.5 days decade−1 in Europe. Our analysis of 254 mean national time series undoubtedly demonstrates that species' phenology is responsive to temperature of the preceding months (mean advance of spring/summer by 2.5 days°C−1, delay of leaf colouring and fall by 1.0 day°C−1). The pattern of observed change in spring efficiently matches measured national warming across 19 European countries (correlation coefficient r=−0.69, P{\textless}0.001).},

	abstract = {Background Anthropogenic climate change (ACC) will influence all aspects of plant biology over coming decades. Many changes in wild species have already been well-documented as a result of increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations, warming climate and changing precipitation regimes. A wealth of available data has allowed the use of meta-analyses to examine plant–climate interactions on more sophisticated levels than before. These analyses have revealed major differences in plant response among groups, e.g. with respect to functional traits, taxonomy, life-history and provenance. Interestingly, these meta-analyses have also exposed unexpected mismatches between theory, experimental, and observational studies.Scope We reviewed the literature on species’ responses to ACC, finding ∼42 \% of 4000 species studied globally are plants (primarily terrestrial). We review impacts on phenology, distributions, ecophysiology, regeneration biology, plant–plant and plant–herbivore interactions, and the roles of plasticity and evolution. We focused on apparent deviations from expectation, and highlighted cases where more sophisticated analyses revealed that unexpected changes were, in fact, responses to ACC.Conclusions We found that conventionally expected responses are generally well-understood, and that it is the aberrant responses that are now yielding greater insight into current and possible future impacts of ACC. We argue that inconclusive, unexpected, or counter-intuitive results should be embraced in order to understand apparent disconnects between theory, prediction, and observation. We highlight prime examples from the collection of papers in this Special Issue, as well as general literature. We found use of plant functional groupings/traits had mixed success, but that some underutilized approaches, such as Grime's C/S/R strategies, when incorporated, have improved understanding of observed responses. Despite inherent difficulties, we highlight the need for ecologists to conduct community-level experiments in systems that replicate multiple aspects of ACC. Specifically, we call for development of coordinating experiments across networks of field sites, both natural and man-made.},

	abstract = {As a consequence of warming temperatures around the world, spring and autumn phenologies have been shifting, with corresponding changes in the length of the growing season. Our understanding of the spatial and interspecific variation of these changes, however, is limited. Not all species are responding similarly, and there is significant spatial variation in responses even within species. This spatial and interspecific variation complicates efforts to predict phenological responses to ongoing climate change, but must be incorporated in order to build reliable forecasts. Here, we use a long-term dataset (1953–2005) of plant phenological events in spring (flowering and leaf out) and autumn (leaf colouring and leaf fall) throughout Japan and South Korea to build forecasts that account for these sources of variability. Specifically, we used hierarchical models to incorporate the spatial variability in phenological responses to temperature to then forecast species' overall and site-specific responses to global warming. We found that for most species, spring phenology is advancing and autumn phenology is getting later, with the timing of events changing more quickly in autumn compared with the spring. Temporal trends and phenological responses to temperature in East Asia contrasted with results from comparable studies in Europe, where spring events are changing more rapidly than are autumn events. Our results emphasize the need to study multiple species at many sites to understand and forecast regional changes in phenology.},

	abstract = {Current evidence of phenological responses to recent climate change is substantially biased towards northern hemisphere temperate regions. Given regional differences in climate change, shifts in phenology will not be uniform across the globe, and conclusions drawn from temperate systems in the northern hemisphere might not be applicable to other regions on the planet. We conduct the largest meta-analysis to date of phenological drivers and trends among southern hemisphere species, assessing 1208 long-term datasets from 89 studies on 347 species. Data were mostly from Australasia (Australia and New Zealand), South America and the Antarctic/subantarctic, and focused primarily on plants and birds. This meta-analysis shows an advance in the timing of spring events (with a strong Australian data bias), although substantial differences in trends were apparent among taxonomic groups and regions. When only statistically significant trends were considered, 82\% of terrestrial datasets and 42\% of marine datasets demonstrated an advance in phenology. Temperature was most frequently identified as the primary driver of phenological changes; however, in many studies it was the only climate variable considered. When precipitation was examined, it often played a key role but, in contrast with temperature, the direction of phenological shifts in response to precipitation variation was difficult to predict a priori. We discuss how phenological information can inform the adaptive capacity of species, their resilience, and constraints on autonomous adaptation. We also highlight serious weaknesses in past and current data collection and analyses at large regional scales (with very few studies in the tropics or from Africa) and dramatic taxonomic biases. If accurate predictions regarding the general effects of climate change on the biology of organisms are to be made, data collection policies focussing on targeting data-deficient regions and taxa need to be financially and logistically supported.},

Research on extreme events (“event-focused” in contrast to “trend-focused”) has increased in recent years and, in 2004, accounted for one-fifth of the experimental climate-change studies published. Numerous examples, ranging from microbiology and soil science to biogeography, demonstrate how extreme weather events can accelerate shifts in species composition and distribution, thereby facilitating changes in ecosystem functioning. However, assessing the importance of extreme events for ecological processes poses a major challenge because of the very nature of such events: their effects are out of proportion to their short duration. We propose that extreme events can be characterized by statistical extremity, timing, and abruptness relative to the life cycles of the organisms affected. To test system response to changing magnitude and frequency of weather events, controlled experiments are useful tools. These experiments provide essential insights for science and for societies that must develop coping strategies for such events. Here, we discuss future research needs for climate-change experiments in ecology. For illustration, we describe an experimental plan showing how to meet the challenge posed by changes in the frequency or magnitude of extreme events.},

	abstract = {Forest vertebrate fauna provide critical services, such as pollination and seed dispersal, which underpin functional and resilient ecosystems. In turn, many of these fauna are dependent on the flowering phenology of the plant species of such ecosystems. The impact of changes in climate, including climate extremes, on the interaction between these fauna and flora has not been identified or elucidated, yet influences on flowering phenology are already evident. These changes are well documented in the mid to high latitudes. However, there is emerging evidence that the flowering phenology, nectar/pollen production, and fruit production of long-lived trees in tropical and subtropical forests are also being impacted by changes in the frequency and severity of climate extremes. Here, we examine the implications of these changes for vertebrate fauna dependent on these resources. We review the literature to establish evidence for links between climate extremes and flowering phenology, elucidating the nature of relationships between different vertebrate taxa and flowering regimes. We combine this information with climate change projections to postulate about the likely impacts on nectar, pollen and fruit resource availability and the consequences for dependent vertebrate fauna. The most recent climate projections show that the frequency and intensity of climate extremes will increase during the 21st century. These changes are likely to significantly alter mass flowering and fruiting events in the tropics and subtropics, which are frequently cued by climate extremes, such as intensive rainfall events or rapid temperature shifts. We find that in these systems the abundance and duration of resource availability for vertebrate fauna is likely to fluctuate, and the time intervals between episodes of high resource availability to increase. The combined impact of these changes has the potential to result in cascading effects on ecosystems through changes in pollinator and seed dispersal ecology, and demands a focused research effort.},

We analyze the relationship of leaf and seed fall to climate variation over 30 years in a seasonally dry tropical forest in Panama where El Niño brings warm, dry, and sunny conditions. Elevated leaf fall precedes the onset of El Niño, and elevated seed production follows, paralleling associations with dry seasons. Our results provide evidence of a shift in allocation from leafing to fruiting in response to a warming phase of ENSO. This shift may enable plants to take advantage of higher light availability, while coping with higher atmospheric water demand and lower water supply. These findings might be an indicator of adaptive strategies to optimize reproduction and resource acquisition.},

	abstract = {Explaining how and why some species evolved to have more complex social structures than others has been a long-term goal for many researchers in animal behaviour because it would provide important insight into the links between evolution and ecology, sociality and cognition. However, despite long-standing interest, the evolution of social complexity is still poorly understood. This may be due in part to researchers focusing on the feasibility of quantifying aspects of sociality, rather than what features are characteristic of animal social complexity in the first place. Any given approach to studying complexity can tell us some things about animal sociality, but may miss others, so it is critical to decide first how to conceptualize complexity before jumping in to quantifying it. Here, we briefly summarize five existing approaches to measuring social complexity. Then, we highlight three fundamental concepts that are commonly used in the field of complex systems: (1) scales of organization, (2) compression and (3) emergence. All of these concepts are applicable to the study of animal social systems, but are not often explicitly addressed in existing social complexity measures. We discuss how these concepts can provide a rigorous foundation for conceptualizing social complexity, the potential benefits of incorporating them and how existing measures do (or do not) include them. Ultimately, researchers need to critically evaluate any measure of animal social complexity in order to balance the biological relevance of the aspect of sociality they are quantifying with the feasibility of obtaining enough data.},

It has been established that the brain solves this problem, in part, by representing social information in an agent-centric manner; knowledge about others’ abilities or attitudes is tagged to individuals such as ‘oneself’ or the ‘other’1–6. This intuitive approach has informed the understanding of key nodes in the social parts of the brain, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)7–9. However, the patterns or combinations in which individuals might interact with one another is as important as the identities of the individuals. Here, in four studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging, behavioural experiments and a social group decision-making task, we show that the dmPFC and ACC represent the combinatorial possibilities for social interaction afforded by a given situation, and that they do so in a compressed format resembling the basis functions used in spatial, visual and motor domains10–12. The basis functions align with social interaction types, as opposed to individual identities. Our results indicate that there are deep analogies between abstract neural coding schemes in the visual and motor domain and the construction of our sense of social identity.},

	abstract = {It is well supported that the present diversity of animal cognitive abilities is the result of evolutionary processes, driven at least in part by natural selection. However, the evolutionary dynamics that link individual traits to fitness to macroevolutionary patterns of variation in cognition are much less clear. Is cognitive evolution fast or slow? Does selection tend to act on existing genetic variation or is adaptive cognitive evolution mutation limited? Is there a consistent pattern to the mode and tempo of cognitive evolution across groups or does it vary depending on different social and ecological pressures? Answering these questions will allow us to understand the connections between heritable variation in cognition in extant populations and the divergence in cognitive abilities across species. We review what is currently known about cognition and individual variation in fitness and discuss how fitness observed in current populations may be linked with patterns of natural selection. We provide a brief overview of relevant concepts from the population genomics literature and suggest a research agenda that integrates behavioural ecological approaches with comparative and population genomics data to uncover the patterns of cognition evolution.

	abstract = {Recent efforts to understand the evolution of cognition have adopted a within-species approach where cognitive performance, and its effects on behaviour, is correlated with fitness benefits and, if related, is assumed to be selected for. We reviewed 45 studies taking this approach, involving 26 species and describing 211 relationships between behavioural measures of cognition and fitness, to explore broader patterns underlying the evolution of cognition. First, we explored patterns in the strength and direction of selection. We found generally weak support for a relationship between cognition and fitness, with {\textgreater}70\% of raw published relationships being statistically non-significant, with an even smaller likelihood once co-variates were accounted for. Where significant relationships were found, they were predominantly, but not exclusively, positive, with individuals exhibiting faster learning or more accurate memory also displaying greater (proxy) fitness. Second, we tested how selection might act under different circumstances. A relationship with fitness was more likely when general, rather than specific cognitive entities were considered, and when the fitness measure corresponded to survival rather than reproductive output. Consequently, the study of within-species cognitive evolution remains in its early stages, with evidence that is both incomplete and inconclusive. However, it potentially offers a powerful opportunity to explore the structure of cognition, trade-offs, constraints and the way that it links to behaviours.

A key reason is the lack of research tools to infer the causes of a unique event for which experiments are not possible. We describe how the analogous problem of why there is day and night has been successfully addressed in physics and learning from that experience, we outline a strategy to address why the human brain size evolved: hypotheses are expressed in mechanistic models that yield quantitative predictions for evolutionary and developmental trajectories of brain and body sizes, the predicted trajectories are compared to data, and models are chosen by their ability to explain the data. By pursuing this strategy, we present results from one model that predicts evolutionary and developmental trajectories for six hominin species. We compare these predictions to data, finding that the model recovers multiple but not all aspects of hominin evolution and development. Counterintuitively, the human brain size evolves in this model as a spandrel, that is, as a byproduct of selection for something else, specifically, preovulatory ovarian follicles. Our analysis describes an alternative way forward to infer why the human brain size evolved.},

	abstract = {Multiple primate species, including humans, have evolved brains that are surprisingly large relative to their body sizes. Studies of this variation have focused on either proximate (how) or ultimate (why) explanations by correlating species-average brain sizes with, e.g. the rate of genetic changes or certain socioecological variables, respectively. Here, we combined proximate and ultimate perspectives to identify genes that modulated the coevolutionary relationship between diet quality and relative brain size in primates. For            n            = 50 species, we estimated selection pressure (i.e. root-to-tip d            N            /d            S            ) for approximately 8K genes and collected brain size, body size and diet quality data. We first used this novel dataset to build on previous studies and bolster findings that neurogenesis-related genes facilitate evolutionary changes in brain size. We then applied phylogenetic partial correlation analysis (to identify genes correlated with both brain size and diet quality) and phylogenetic path analysis (to compare different causal models). We found dozens of genes that may have facilitated the coevolution of diet quality and brain size in primates and show that these genes are involved in neurodevelopment and energy metabolism. This is likely to reflect that higher-quality diets provide more energy to grow and maintain metabolically expensive brains. Our novel approach provides new insight into the drivers of primate brain size evolution.

	abstract = {Cognition serves to resolve uncertainty. Living in social groups is widely seen as a source of uncertainty driving cognitive evolution, but sociality can also mitigate sources of uncertainty, reducing the need for cognition. Moreover, social systems are not simply external selection pressures, but rather arise from the decisions individuals make regarding who to interact with and how to behave. Thus, an understanding of how and why cognition evolves requires careful consideration of the co-evolutionary feedback loop between cognition and sociality. Here, we adopt ideas from information theory to evaluate how potential sources of uncertainty differ across species and social systems. Whereas cognitive research often focuses on identifying human-like abilities in other animals, we instead emphasise that animals need to make adaptive decisions to navigate socio-ecological trade-offs. These decisions can be viewed as feedback loops between perceiving and acting on information, which shape individuals’ immediate social interactions, and scale up to generate the structure of societies. Emerging group-level characteristics such as social structure, communication networks, and culture in turn produce the context in which decisions are made and so shape selection on the underlying cognitive processes. Thus, minds shape societies and societies shape minds.},

            Capture of non-human primates is the only way that research questions requiring unequivocal identification can be answered. Much of the current research on primates remains cross-sectional and of short duration. In addition, capture is the only way to take advantage of the ongoing revolution in miniaturization that allows the use of lab-based technologies on wild primates. These physiological data provide insight on how behaviour is related to variable weather conditions, available energy, and food choices, thus, relating environmental variation to behavioural and physiological data. The behaviour and physiology of free-ranging primates results from the interaction of numerous factors that cannot be adequately replicated in the laboratory. These factors include food supply, food quality, predation, social interactions, and three-dimensional variation in forest weather conditions. Thus, existing data from lab studies may not provide an ecologically, and therefore evolutionarily, relevant explanation of most primate behaviour or physiology in response to environmental variation. This chapter outlines methods for the capture of non-human primates including darting, anaesthesia, and handling, including general recommendations for drug dosages as well as approaches to ensure the safety of the handler(s).},

	abstract = {Answering the fundamental ecological question of what determines animal abundance has become critical with the accelerating need for informed management plans for endangered species. A major difficulty in testing general hypotheses to account for variation in abundance is that periods of food scarcity, which may be responsible for limiting population size, occur on a superannual basis. Research on folivorous primates suggests that periods of food scarcity are critical in determining regional biomass; however, studies of frugivores have found no single fallback food generally used by all species. In this study we quantify fruit availability during a 12-year period in Kibale National Park, Uganda to determine patterns of fruit scarcity. Over these 12 years, temporal variability in fruit availability was high; the proportion of trees per month with ripe fruit varied from 0.14 to 15.93\%. In addition, there was dramatic interannual variation in fruit availability: in 1990, on average only 1.09\% of trees bore ripe fruit each month, while in 1999 an average of 6.67\% of trees bore fruit each month. Over the past 12 years, fruit has become more available, fruit-scarce months have declined in frequency, and the duration of periods of fruit scarcity has decreased. If figs (Ficus spp.) served as a fallback food resource over these 12 years, they would have had to be available during months when few trees were fruiting. Over this 149-month period, there were 34 months when less than 1\% of monitored trees fruited. Figs were not fruiting in 17 of these months, and, in only 11 of the 34 months were more than 1\% of the fig trees fruiting. Rainfall data collected since 1903 indicates that the region is becoming moister, and droughts are less frequent. There has also been a significant increase in the maximum mean monthly temperature and a decrease in the minimum mean monthly temperature since we started recording these data in 1990.},

	abstract = {Social complexity reflects the intricate patterns of social interactions in societies. Understanding social complexity is fundamental for studying the evolution of diverse social systems and the cognitive innovations used to cope with the demands of social life. Social complexity has been predominantly quantified by social unit size, but newer measures of social complexity reflect the diversity of relationships. However, the association between these two sets of measures remains unclear. We used 12 years of data on 13 gorilla groups to investigate how measures of social complexity relate to each other. We found that group size was a poor proxy for relationship diversity and that the social complexity individuals experienced within the same group varied greatly. Our findings demonstrate two fundamental takeaways: first, that the number of relationships and the diversity of those relationships represent separate components of social complexity, both of which should be accounted for; and second, that social complexity measured at the group level may not represent the social complexity experienced by individuals in those groups. These findings suggest that comprehensive studies of social complexity, particularly those relating to the social demands faced by individuals, may require fine-scale social data to allow accurate comparisons across populations and species.},
