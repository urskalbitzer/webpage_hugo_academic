abstract: 'With 60% of all primate species now threatened with extinction and many
  species only persisting in small populations in forest fragments, conservation action
  is urgently needed. But what type of action? Here we argue that restoration of primate
  habitat will be an essential component of strategies aimed at conserving primates
  and preventing the extinctions that may occur before the end of the century and
  propose that primates can act as flagship species for restoration efforts. To do
  this we gathered a team of academics from around the world with experience in restoration
  so that we could provide examples of why primate restoration ecology is needed,
  outline how primates can act as flagship species for restoration efforts of tropical
  forest, review what little is known about how primate populations respond to restoration
  efforts, and make specific recommendations of the next steps needed to make restoration
  of primate populations successful. We set four priorities: (1) academics must effectively
  communicate both the value of primates and the need for restoration; (2) more research
  is needed on how primates contribute to forest restoration; (3) more effort must
  be put into Masters and PhD level training for tropical country nationals; and finally
  (4) more emphasis is needed to monitor the responses of regenerating forest and
  primate populations where restoration efforts are initiated. We are optimistic that
  populations of many threatened species can recover, and extinctions can be prevented,
  but only if concerted large-scale efforts are made soon and if these efforts include
  primate habitat restoration.'
