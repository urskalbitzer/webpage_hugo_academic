abstract: Objectives  Primate social systems are remarkably diverse, and thus play
  a central role in understanding social evolution, including the biological origin
  of human societies. Although baboons have been prominently featured in this context,
  historically little was known about the westernmost member of the genus, the Guinea
  baboon (Papio papio).   Material and Methods  Here, we summarize the findings from
  the first years of observations at the field site CRP Simenti in the Niokolo Koba
  National Park in Senegal.   Results  Guinea baboons reveal a nested multi-level
  social organization, with reproductive units comprising one “primary” male, one
  to several females, young, and occasionally “secondary” males at the base of the
  society. Three to five units form “parties,” which team up with other parties to
  form a “gang.” Different gangs have largely overlapping home ranges and agonistic
  interactions between different parties or gangs are rare. Some but not all strongly
  socially bonded males are highly related, and population genetic and behavioral
  evidence indicate female-biased dispersal. Females play an important role in intersexual
  bond formation and maintenance, and female tenure length varies between a few weeks
  to several years.   Discussion  While the social organization resembles that of
  hamadryas baboons (P. hamadryas), the social structure differs considerably, specifically
  in terms of low male aggressiveness and female freedom. Despite substantial differences
  in social organization and social structure, the acoustic structure of Guinea baboon
  vocalizations does not differ substantially from that of other baboon taxa. With
  its multi-level organization, stable bonds between males and females, as well as
  a high-degree of male-male cooperation and tolerance, Guinea baboons constitute
  an intriguing model for reconstructing human social evolution.
