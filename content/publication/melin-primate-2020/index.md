abstract: Research on non-human primates in the endangered tropical dry forest of
  Sector Santa Rosa (SSR), Área de Conservación Guanacaste (ACG), was launched in
  1983 and is now one of the longest running studies of primates globally. Such continuous
  study provides a rare opportunity to ask questions that are only answerable through
  decades-long monitoring of these long-lived monkeys. In turn, the mounting data
  generated by long-term study, including knowledge of lifetime reproductive success,
  familial relatedness, comprehensive behavioral and dietary repertoires, and patterns
  of inter- and intra-annual variation in forest productivity, provide diverse opportunities
  to researchers, and facilitate studies that are of shorter duration. Here, we review
  some of the contributions of our longitudinal research on white-faced capuchins
  and Geoffroy's spider monkeys, together with newer studies on mantled howler monkeys.
  We begin by synthesizing findings from our research on demography, dispersal, social
  relationships, and reproduction. These life history and social traits interact with
  their foraging and sensory ecology, which we review next. We end by highlighting
  how the longitudinal study of primates in Sector Santa Rosa has made direct and
  indirect contributions to the conservation of the critically endangered dry forest
  biome and its inhabitants, as well as to education, community, and forest restoration
  initiatives. In particular, we focus our review on how long-term research is uniquely
  positioned to make key contributions spanning different topical areas. Abstract
  in Spanish is available with online material.
