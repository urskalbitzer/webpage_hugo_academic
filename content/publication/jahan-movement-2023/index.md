abstract: Abstract  Flies form high-density associations with human settlements and
  groups of nonhuman primates and are implicated in transmitting pathogens. We investigate
  the movement of nonhuman primate-associated flies across landscapes surrounding
  Kibale National Park, Uganda, using a mark–recapture experiment. Flies were marked
  in nine nonhuman primate groups at the forest edge (   $$overlinex$$   x ¯     = 929
  flies per group), and we then attempted to recapture them in more anthropized areas
  (50 m, 200 m and 500 m from where marked; 2–21 days after marking). Flies marked
  in nonhuman primate groups were recaptured in human areas (19/28,615 recaptured).
  Metabarcoding of the flies in nonhuman primate groups revealed the DNA of multiple
  eukaryotic primate parasites. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential
  of flies to serve as vectors between nonhuman primates, livestock and humans at
  this biodiverse interface.
