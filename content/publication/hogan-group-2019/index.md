abstract: Primates have long been used as indicator species for assessing overall
  ecosystem health. However, area-wide census methods are time consuming, costly,
  and not always feasible under many field conditions. Therefore, it is important
  to establish whether monitoring a subset of a population accurately reflects demographic
  changes occurring in the population at large. Over the past 35 years, we have conducted
  15 area-wide censuses in Sector Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. These efforts have revealed
  important trends in population growth patterns of capuchin monkeys following the
  protection and subsequent regeneration of native forests. During this same period,
  we have also intensively studied a subset of the capuchin groups. Comparing these
  two datasets, we investigate whether the population structures of the closely monitored
  groups are reliable indicators of area-wide demographic patterns. We compare the
  overall group size and the individual age/sex class compositions of study groups
  and nonstudy groups (i.e., those contacted during area-wide censuses only). Our
  study groups contained more individuals overall with a larger proportion of infants,
  and there were indications that the proportion of adult and subadult males was lower.
  These differences can be ascribed either to sampling errors or real differences
  attributable to human presence and/or better habitat quality for the study groups.
  No other sex/age classes differed, and major demographic changes were simultaneously
  evident in both study and nonstudy groups. This study suggests that the Santa Rosa
  capuchin population is similarly impacted by large-scale ecological patterns observable
  within our study groups.
