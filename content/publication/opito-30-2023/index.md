abstract: World-­wide declines in arthropod abundance and diversity are a major concern,
  particularly given their importance in ecosystem functioning. Yet, data documenting
  long-­term trends are rare from the tropics, particularly the Afrotropics. Here
  we evaluate changes in the arthropod communities in Kibale National Park, Uganda
  across almost four decades. Systematic sweep-­net sampling was conducted in two
  forested sections of the park that had been logged and in one old-­growth forest
  area over 12 consecutive months in 1983/1984 and 2020/2021. This data was augmented
  with intermittent samples taken in 1986 and 1995. Arthropod abundance declined in
  all areas, but only significantly so in the moderately logged forestry compartment
  (41%). Permutational multivariate analysis of variance indicated that community
  compositions of arthropods differed between the censuses. Understanding the drivers
  of changes in the arthropod communities is difficult as the system is complex and
  dynamic. We document an increase in temperature, but no change in rainfall, increases
  in 11 mammal species, including a marked increase in elephant numbers, and changes
  in forest structure. We also report on changes in the landscape outside of the park,
  which includes the human population increasing by a factor of four and agricultural
  intensification that now includes the use of pesticides. We document that many components
  of the ecosystem we studied changed simultaneously, which signals that for effective
  conservation planning, more long-­term multi-­disciplinary efforts are needed.
