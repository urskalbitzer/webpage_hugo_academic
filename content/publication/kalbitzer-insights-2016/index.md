abstract: Aggressive behaviors are an integral part of competitive interactions. There
  is considerable variation in aggressiveness among individuals both within and among
  species. Aggressiveness is a quantitative trait that is highly heritable. In modern
  humans and macaques (Macaca spp.), variation in aggressiveness among individuals
  is associated with polymorphisms in the serotonergic (5-HT) neurotransmitter system.
  To further investigate the genetics underlying interspecific variation in aggressiveness,
  123 wild individuals from five baboon species (Papio papio, P. hamadryas, P. anubis,
  P. cynocephalus, and P. ursinus) were screened for two polymorphisms in promoter
  regions of genes relevant for the 5-HT system (5-HTTLPR and MAOALPR).
