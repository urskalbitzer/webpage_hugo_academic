abstract: 'A key goal in behavioral ecology is to investigate the factors influencing
  the access to food resources and energetic condition of females, which are strong
  predictors of their reproductive success. We aimed to investigate how ecological
  factors, social factors, and reproductive state are associated with energetic condition
  in a wild neotropical primate using non-invasive measures. We first assessed and
  compared urinary C-peptide levels (uCP), the presence of urinary ketones (uKet),
  and behaviorally assessed energy balance (bEB) in female white-faced capuchin monkeys
  (Cebus imitator) living in Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. Then, we assessed how these measures
  were associated with feeding competition, dominance rank, and reproductive state.
  As predicted, uCP and bEB were positively associated with each other, and bEB was
  negatively associated with uKet. However, we did not find a relationship between
  uCP and uKet. Females showed lower uCP and bEB values during periods of intense
  feeding competition, but this relationship was not dependent on dominance rank.
  Furthermore, rank was not directly associated with uCP and bEB. Urinary ketones,
  on the other hand, were only produced in the most adverse conditions: by low-ranking,
  lactating females during periods of intense feeding competition. Behavioral strategies
  are assumed to maximize reproductive success and not energetic condition per se,
  which might explain why rank was not generally associated with energetic condition
  in our study population. This highlights the importance of considering potential
  differences between reproductive success and proxies of reproductive success, such
  as energetic condition or food intake, when investigating predictions of socioecological
  models.'
