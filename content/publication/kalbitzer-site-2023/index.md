abstract: 'The ability to move allows animals to optimize their fitness by responding
  to spatial variability in their environment, such as changes in the location of
  food resources, predators, parasites, competitors, or reproductive partners. However,
  many animals remain within a limited area throughout their lives. Such site fidelity
  has been reported for social groups of nonhuman primates and other mammals over
  many years or even decades. The few studies that have addressed and confirmed long-term
  site fidelity in primates have focused on species feeding on presumably unevenly
  distributed food resources, such as fruit, which indicates heterogeneous habitat
  quality, a factor often considered to decrease site fidelity. However, if we want
  to test and extend theories about the ecological factors linked to site fidelity,
  including the role of habitat quality heterogeneity, studies about species feeding
  on more evenly distributed foods, such as leaves, are essential. Therefore, we here
  investigate the long-term ranging pattern of the leaf-eating (and endangered) red
  colobus (Piliocolobus tephrosceles) in Kibale National Park. For the period from
  2010 until 2019, we established home range density estimates (HRDE) for our main
  study group for annual, 6-month, and 3-month periods via “autocorrelated kernel
  density estimation.” Then, we compared changes in these HRDEs across time using
  three metrics: (1) the “overlap” of HRDEs, which is a measure of similarity between
  (probability) distributions that reflect the estimated home ranges, (2) the distance
  between the centroids of the HRDEs, and (3) the distances between the points of
  maximum density of HRDEs. Our results indicate high home site fidelity for red colobus,
  as our study group was still using the same area after 10 years. Although these
  results are as expected, it is important to note that this pattern is similar in
  primates with other types of diet (including fruit). Thus, going forward, it will
  be crucial to quantitatively assess heterogeneity in food distribution for different
  types of diet and study additional factors that may lead to such a high site fidelity
  in many primates.'
