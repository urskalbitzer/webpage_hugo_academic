abstract: Efficient foraging plays a critical role in fitness, yet food choices and
  underlying nutritional goals vary among animals. To understand those choices and
  therefore the importance of different food resources, many studies estimate food
  preferences by applying electivity indices that account for resource availabilities.
  However, the general applicability of electivity indices in biologically relevant
  foraging scenarios is unclear. Our major aims were to find effective methods to
  estimate animals' food choices and to investigate long-term food choices and underlying
  nutritional goals of the red colobus monkey (Piliocolobus tephrosceles) in Kibale
  National Park, Uganda, an endangered folivore. We used simulations of different
  foraging conditions to evaluate the applicability of electivity indices in biologically
  relevant scenarios to help interpret our results. Then, we used long-term data collected
  between 2006 and 2016 on the feeding behavior and ecology of red colobus to determine
  the consumption frequencies of different foods and their food preferences. Based
  on these results and nutritional concentrations of young leaves of frequently consumed
  tree species, we investigated the importance of the protein-to-fiber ratio in their
  diet. Our simulations highlight limitations of electivity indices in biologically
  relevant foraging scenarios. Further, red colobus clearly chose young leaves over
  other plant parts, and, considering species and plant part, red colobus fed on many
  different items, but few dominated their diet. The availability and spatial distribution
  varied across the most consumed foods, but red colobus preferences remained mostly
  stable over time. Protein-to-fiber ratio had no association with preference but
  with consumption frequencies of different young leaves. The limitations of electivity
  indices in different foraging conditions underline the importance of comparing food
  preferences with consumption frequencies to assess the importance of different food
  resources. Our results provide a robust understanding of the food choices and nutritional
  goals of a leaf-eating animal that can ultimately be used for implementing more
  effective conservation measures by directing habitat protection or restoration efforts
  toward these resources.
