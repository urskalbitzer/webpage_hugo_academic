abstract: Abstract Historically, Internet access has been linked to a country’s wealth.
  However, starting a decade ago, this situation changed dramatically and Internet
  access became increasingly available in primate range countries. The rapid growth
  of smartphone use in developing nations has created new avenues to communicate conservation.
  Here we assess the potential of social media to promote primate conservation at
  the local level within primate range countries. We interviewed 381 people in communities
  associated with 18 conservation projects from 11 countries to assess their use of
  social media. We found that 91% of the people had at least one social media account
  and 95% of these people checked their accounts daily. The median number of contacts
  per person across all platforms was 453 and 300 considering only each person’s most
  used platform. We also documented that local conservation projects had a diversity
  of information they wanted to relay to the local community through social media.
  Our research highlights the potential for social media to be an extremely useful
  communication tool for tropical conservation scientists. Thus, we encourage more
  conservation groups to explore using social media to communicate to local communities
  and to report on the impact it has on conservation.
