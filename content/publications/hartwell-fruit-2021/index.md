abstract: Understanding the ecological and social factors that influence group size
  is a major focus of primate behavioural ecology. Studies of species with fission–fusion
  social organizations have offered an insightful tool for understanding ecological
  drivers of group size as associations change over short temporal and spatial scales.
  Here we investigated how the fission–fusion dynamics of spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi)
  at Runaway Creek, Belize were affected by fruit availability. When males and females
  were analyzed together, we found no association between fruit availability and subgroup
  size. However, when females were analyzed separately, we found that when fruit availability
  increased, so did subgroup size. In all analyses, higher fruit availability did
  not influence subgroup spatial cohesion. Our results point to the complexity of
  understanding grouping patterns, in that while ecological factors make groups of
  specific sizes advantageous, social factors also play an important determining role.
