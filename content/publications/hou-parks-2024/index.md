abstract: Establishing protected areas is a key element of most conservation strategies,
  but continuous effective management is needed to ensure that biodiversity is protected.
  Here we provide an evaluation of park effectiveness by quantifying changes in the
  abundance of the commonly occurring ungulates (bushbuck - Tragelaphus scriptus;
  red duiker - Cephalophus harveyi; blue duiker - Cephalophus moniticola, bushpigs
  - Potomochoerus larvatus, and giant forest hogs - Hylochoerus meinertzhageni), and
  African elephants (forest elephants - Loxodonta cyclotis, savanna elephants Loxodonta
  africana, and their hybrids) in Kibale National Park, Uganda and consider the financial
  commitment needed to ensure protection. Following the upgrading of the protection
  of Kibale from a forest reserve to a national park, wildlife populations generally
  increased. Bushpigs are an exception and their populations appear stable. The increases
  of ungulate and elephant pop­ ulations typically happened soon after park establishment,
  with the exception of the giant forest hog that only recently showed an increase.
  We conducted an assessment of Uganda Wildlife Authorities budget and those of the
  small NGOs working in the area and considered the contri­ bution that Makerere University
  Biological Field Stations makes to the community. This analysis indicates that with
  a small budget UWA and its collaborators have been successful in protecting the
  park’s ungulate and elephant populations. While the past decades have demonstrated
  the park’s ability to conserve biodiversity with limited resources, the changing
  climate and mounting pressures faced by the park will necessitate significantly
  increased investments.
