abstract: Most mammals live in social groups in which members form differentiated
  social relationships. Individuals may vary in their degree of sociality, and this
  variation can be associated with differential fitness. In some species, for example,
  female sociality has a positive effect on infant survival. However, investigations
  of such cases are still rare, and no previous study has considered how male infanticide
  might constrain effects of female sociality on infant survival. Infanticide is part
  of the male reproductive strategy in many mammals, and it has the potential to override,
  or even reverse, effects of female reproductive strategies, including sociality.
  Therefore, we investigated the relationships between female sociality, offspring
  survival, and infanticide risk in wild white-faced capuchin monkeys using long-term
  data from Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. Female capuchins formed differentiated bonds,
  and bond strength was predicted by kin relationship, rank difference, and the presence
  of female infants. Most females formed stable bonds with their top social partners,
  although bond stability varied considerably. Offspring of highly social females,
  who were often high-ranking females, exhibited higher survivorship during stable
  periods compared with offspring of less social females. However, offspring of highly
  social females were more likely to die or disappear during periods of alpha male
  replacements, probably because new alpha males are central to the group, and therefore
  more likely to target the infants of highly social, central females. This study
  shows that female sociality in mammals can have negative fitness consequences that
  are imposed by male behavior.
