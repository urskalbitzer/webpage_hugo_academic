abstract: The complex, interconnected, and non-contiguous nature of canopy environments
  present unique cognitive, locomotor, and sensory challenges to their animal inhabitants.
  Animal movement through forest canopies is constrained; unlike most aquatic or aerial
  habitats, the three-dimensional space of a forest canopy is not fully realized or
  available to the animals within it. Determining how the unique constraints of arboreal
  habitats shape the ecology and evolution of canopy-dwelling animals is key to fully
  understanding forest ecosystems. With emerging technologies, there is now the opportunity
  to quantify and map tree connectivity, and to embed the fine-scale horizontal and
  vertical position of moving animals into these networks of branching pathways. Integrating
  detailed multi-dimensional habitat structure and animal movement data will enable
  us to see the world from the perspective of an arboreal animal. This synthesis will
  shed light on fundamental aspects of arboreal animals’ cognition and ecology, including
  how they navigate landscapes of risk and reward and weigh energetic trade-offs,
  as well as how their environment shapes their spatial cognition and their social
  dynamics.
