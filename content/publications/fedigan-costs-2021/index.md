abstract: Objectives Infanticide in white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus imitator)
  typically occurs in association with alpha male replacements (AMRs). Although infanticide
  is likely adaptive for males, it imposes costs on females that are difficult to
  quantify without long-term demographic data. Here we investigate effects of AMRs
  and infanticide on female reproductive success and how these costs affect capuchin
  groups. We investigate (1) effects of AMR frequency on the production of surviving
  infants; (2) energetic and (3) temporal “opportunity costs” of infant loss; and
  (4) how AMR frequency impacts capuchin group sizes. Materials and methods We censused
  six groups (7–33 years/group, 74 adult females). We modeled surviving infant production
  in relation to AMR. We estimated a female's energy requirements for lost infants
  and the temporal cost relative to the median reproductive window. We simulated how
  varying AMR rates would affect future capuchin group sizes. Results Females exposed
  to more frequent AMR tended to produce fewer surviving offspring. We estimate the
  average lost infant requires approximately 33% additional energy intake for its
  mother and represents 10% of the average reproductive opportunity window available
  to females. Simulated populations remain viable at the observed rate of AMR occurrence
  but decrease in size at even slightly higher rates. Discussion While infanticide
  is adaptive for males, for females it affects lifetime reproductive success and
  imposes energetic and opportunity costs. Although capuchin populations have evolved
  with AMRs and infanticide, small increases in AMR frequency may lead to population
  decline/extinction. Infanticide likely plays a large role in population maintenance
  for capuchins.
