abstract: Many primate populations are threatened by human actions and a central tool
  used for their protection is establishing protected areas. However, even if populations
  in such areas are protected from hunting and deforestation, they still may be threatened
  by factors such as climate change and its cascading impacts on habitat quality and
  disease dynamics. Here we provide a long‐term and geographically widespread population
  assessment of the five common diurnal primates of Kibale National Park, Uganda.
  Over 7 year‐long or longer census efforts that spanned 52 years, our team walked
  1466 km, and recorded 480 monkey groups. Populations were generally relatively stable
  with a few exceptions, for which no apparent causative factors could be identified.
  This stability is unexpected as many ecological changes documented over the last
  34+ years (e.g., decreasing food abundance and quality) were predicted to have negative
  impacts. Populations of some species declined at some sites but increased at others.
  This highlights the need for large, protected areas so that declines in particular
  areas are countered by gains in others. Kibale has large areas of regenerating forest
  and this most recent survey revealed that after 20+ years, forest regeneration in
  many of these areas appears sufficient to sustain sizeable primate populations,
  except for blue monkeys that have not colonized these areas. Indeed, the average
  primate abundance in the regenerating forest was only 8.1% lower than in neighboring
  old‐growth forest. Thus, park‐wide primate abundance has likely increased, despite
  many pressures on the park having risen; however, some areas in the park remain
  to be assessed. Our study suggests that the restoration, patrolling, and community
  outreach efforts of the Uganda Wildlife Authority and their partners have contributed
  significantly to protecting the park and its animals.
